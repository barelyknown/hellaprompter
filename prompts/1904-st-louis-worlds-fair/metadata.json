  "sceneDescription": "A bustling promenade with sweeping neoclassical facades under a blinding midday sun. Groups of turn-of-the-century visitors in straw boaters and high collars peer up at towering white pavilions. One frazzled groundskeeper stands precariously on a tall ladder, painting a small smudge back to pristine white. A sense of awe and fleeting spectacle lingers in the air as the temporary grandeur sparkles in the heat.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "2\n\nThis illustration best captures the essence of the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair with its sweeping neoclassical facades and the gathering of turn-of-the-century visitors in straw boaters. The frazzled groundskeeper painting the pavilion adds humor and sophistication, fitting with the New Yorker style. The composition is clear, and the contrast between the colonnade and the figures highlights the grandeur and temporary spectacle of the \"White City.\"",
