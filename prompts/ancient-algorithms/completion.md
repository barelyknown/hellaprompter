# Computing Before Computers: The Forgotten Mathematical Algorithms of Ancient Civilizations

In the shadow of our digital age, it's easy to forget that complex computation predates silicon by millennia. Ancient civilizations developed sophisticated algorithms that solved problems we still grapple with today, albeit using different tools and frameworks.

## Babylonian Square Root Methods

Nearly 4,000 years ago, Babylonian mathematicians developed an iterative algorithm for approximating square roots that is functionally identical to what we now call Newton's Method. Using only basic arithmetic operations, these ancient computers could calculate square roots to remarkable precision.

Their technique began with a reasonable guess, then iteratively improved it using the formula:

*r' = (r + n/r) / 2*

Where *n* is the number whose square root is sought, *r* is the current approximation, and *r'* is the improved approximation.

This method converges quadratically, meaning the number of correct digits roughly doubles with each iteration. Modern computers still use variants of this algorithm today.

## Egyptian Multiplication and Division

The ancient Egyptians approached multiplication and division with algorithms perfectly suited to their notation system. Rather than memorizing multiplication tables, they used a method based entirely on addition and doubling:

1. Write two columns
2. Place the multiplier in the left column, the multiplicand in the right
3. Repeatedly halve the left number (ignoring remainders) and double the right number
4. Cross out rows where the left number is even
5. Sum the remaining right-column values

This algorithm, known as Egyptian multiplication, is mathematically equivalent to binary multiplication—the very foundation of digital computing arithmetic.

## The Euclidean Algorithm

Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers remains one of the oldest continuously used algorithms in existence. Created around 300 BCE, it operates on a deceptively simple principle:

1. If the smaller number divides the larger, it is the GCD
2. Otherwise, replace the larger number with the remainder of dividing it by the smaller number
3. Repeat until a number divides the other exactly

This elegant recursive approach not only calculates GCDs efficiently but laid important groundwork for modern computational concepts like recursion and algorithmic termination.

## The Chinese Remainder Theorem

Ancient Chinese mathematicians developed an algorithm for solving systems of congruences—a technique now called the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This approach efficiently determines a number that leaves specific remainders when divided by different divisors.

Beyond its mathematical elegance, this algorithm had practical applications in calendaring, taxation, and commerce. Today, it forms a cornerstone of modern cryptography and modular computation.

## Algorithmic Thinking Before Formalization

What makes these ancient computational methods remarkable isn't just their effectiveness, but how they emerged without formalized algorithmic concepts or notation. They represent pure algorithmic thinking—systematic problem-solving approaches developed through intuition, necessity, and ingenuity.

The next time you reach for a calculator or spreadsheet, remember that you're participating in a computational tradition that stretches back thousands of years—a tradition that saw ancient scholars calculating with remarkable precision long before the first electronic computer flickered to life.
