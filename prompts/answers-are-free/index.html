Horace Dediu&#039;s quip - &quot;My answers are free, but my questions will cost you&quot; - captures a profound truth about knowledge and insight. On the surface, it suggests that providing straightforward answers is easy (and cheap), but formulating the *right* questions is a rare skill of great value. In a world increasingly awash in information and ready-made answers, this statement invites us to reflect on why **inquiry** - the art of asking meaningful, incisive questions - has always been central to wisdom. From ancient philosophers to modern business gurus, thinkers have echoed the idea that questions drive understanding more than answers do ([Voltaire - Judge a man by his questions rather than his...](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/voltaire_100338)) ([Claude Levi-Strauss - The wise man doesn&#039;t give the right...](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/claude_levistrauss_137171)). This exploration will delve into the philosophical implications of Dediu&#039;s statement, examining its meaning across history and its applications in business, research, education, and technology. We will also see why this idea is **especially relevant in the age of AI and large language models (LLMs)**, when answers are abundant and cheap, but good questions remain precious.

## Historical Perspectives: Wisdom Through Questions

Throughout history, great minds have praised the power of questioning. **Socrates**, the classical Greek philosopher, famously taught by asking questions (the Socratic method) and believed that true wisdom comes from continual inquiry. He asserted that &quot;the highest form of human excellence is to question oneself and others&quot; ([Socratic Questioning in Psychology: Examples and Techniques](https://positivepsychology.com/socratic-questioning/)). For Socrates, an unexamined life - one where we fail to question our own beliefs - was not worth living ([The unexamined life is not worth living - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living)). His legacy shows that **wisdom is not about memorizing answers, but about probing deeper with questions**. This idea reverberates through time: **Voltaire**, for example, advised &quot;Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.&quot; ([Voltaire - Judge a man by his questions rather than his...](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/voltaire_100338)). A person&#039;s questions reveal their curiosity, critical thinking, and insight, whereas answers often simply recite known facts. Anthropologist **Claude Levi-Strauss** put it succinctly: &quot;The wise man doesn&#039;t give the right answers, he poses the right questions.&quot; ([Claude Levi-Strauss - The wise man doesn&#039;t give the right...](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/claude_levistrauss_137171)).

These historical perspectives highlight a key philosophical point: **knowledge is not a static set of answers, but a dynamic process of inquiry**. Every answer, no matter how correct, eventually leads to new questions - a &quot;paradox of science&quot; noted by futurist Kevin Kelly ([Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions](https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/)). Our understanding of the world expands by continuously questioning it. In essence, **questions have always been the driving force of wisdom and human progress**, while answers are stepping stones along the way.

## From Knowledge to Wisdom: The Cost of Insight

Why are good questions &quot;costly&quot; in Dediu&#039;s sense? Philosophically, it is because **insightful questions require deeper understanding and creativity**. Anyone can recall or look up an answer, but it takes **wisdom, experience, and often courage to ask a truly important question**. A good question might challenge assumptions or open new realms of knowledge - and formulating it can be hard work. This is the &quot;cost&quot; of questions: the intellectual effort and intuition needed to pose them. History shows that those who asked bold questions often paid a price for their insights. Socrates&#039; relentless questioning of Athenian society ultimately cost him his life, and many scientific pioneers (like Galileo or Darwin) faced persecution or ridicule for questioning orthodox views. **Inquiry has a cost, but it is the currency of progress.**

There is also an economic metaphor in Dediu&#039;s statement: answers are a commodity, but questions are a service or skill one might pay for. This rings true in fields like consulting or coaching - a consultant&#039;s value is often in diagnosing problems and asking the right strategic questions, rather than just handing out answers. Crafting a powerful question is akin to unlocking a door: it can lead to valuable discoveries or solutions. As the management legend **Peter Drucker** noted, &quot;The most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers... the truly dangerous thing is asking the wrong questions.&quot; In other words, **the quality of our answers depends on the quality of our questions**, and finding the right question is more than half the battle ([The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network](https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/)).

Not all questions are equal. Thoughtless or &quot;dumb&quot; questions yield trivial or useless answers, whereas **thoughtful questions yield insight** ([Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions](https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/)). Formulating a good question requires understanding context, knowing what information is missing, and sometimes thinking creatively or laterally. This is why good questions feel &quot;costly&quot; - they often emerge from extensive knowledge or hard-won experience. It is said that **knowledge is having the right answer, but intelligence (or wisdom) is asking the right question**. In this light, Dediu&#039;s phrase encapsulates the idea that **wisdom cannot be given away easily**; it must be earned through inquiry. Answers might be free, but wisdom - the ability to ask the questions that lead to truth - is invaluable.

## The Role of Inquiry in Human Progress

**Human progress is driven by questions.** Every significant advancement began with someone asking &quot;What if...&quot; or &quot;Why not...&quot; or &quot;How can we improve this?&quot; From the scientific revolution to social reforms, it was the bold questions that challenged the status quo and led to new knowledge. For instance, Newton famously asked why an apple falls down - a simple question that led to formulating the laws of gravity. The innovators and explorers of the Age of Discovery wondered what lay beyond known maps. In philosophy and art, questioning accepted norms gave rise to new schools of thought and creativity.

Crucially, a **good question can illuminate problems and opportunities that were previously unseen**. It is often observed in science that &quot;the question matters more than the answer.&quot; A well-framed research question guides the entire investigation and can yield breakthroughs, whereas a poorly framed question leads nowhere. **Carl Jung** once said, &quot;The right question is already half the solution to a problem.&quot; ([The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network](https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/)). Similarly, engineer and inventor **Charles Kettering** advised that &quot;a problem well-stated is a problem half-solved.&quot; When we identify the right question, the answers tend to fall into place.

Thus, inquiry is not just a philosophical nicety - it has practical power. It is how humans have *invented, discovered,* and *innovated.* Every answer we possess today (in science, technology, etc.) exists because someone asked a question that had not been answered before. In this sense, **questions are the engines of discovery**, and nurturing the ability to question is essential for continued progress.

## In Business and Strategy: Asking Over Answering

In the business world, Dediu&#039;s insight is especially apt. Modern businesses value leaders and strategists who can **ask the right questions about markets, products, and internal processes**. Answers (like data and reports) are readily available, but knowing &quot;which questions to pursue&quot; can set a company apart. For example, a company might have tons of data (answers), but a strategist will ask, &quot;What do our customers truly need that no one is providing?&quot; or &quot;Why are we losing market share in this segment?&quot; These incisive questions can spark strategic shifts or innovations. Legendary IBM CEO Thomas Watson said, &quot;The ability to ask the right question is more than half the battle of finding the answer.&quot; ([The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network](https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/)). Likewise, quality guru **W. Edwards Deming** warned, &quot;If you do not know how to ask the right question, you discover nothing.&quot; ([The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network](https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/)).

Business consultants often exemplify Dediu&#039;s maxim. A consultant&#039;s **answers** (recommendations) might be freely available in books or blogs, but companies hire consultants for their ability to **diagnose the situation and pose critical questions** that internal teams overlooked. Dediu himself, as an industry analyst, likely meant that he can give out answers or facts for free (say, via articles or tweets), but if you want him to analyze your business and &quot;figure out what questions you should be asking,&quot; that expert insight will cost you. In other words, **the real value in consulting or analysis lies in framing the problem - asking the high-value questions - rather than just dispensing facts**.

Moreover, **innovation in business thrives on questioning assumptions**. Companies like Toyota famously use the &quot;5 Whys&quot; technique - asking &quot;why?&quot; repeatedly to drill down to root causes of problems. This shows that systematically asking questions can lead to profound improvements. In entrepreneurial circles, it is said that finding the right problem to solve (a question) is as important as the solution. The **competitive advantage** often goes to those who can identify unmet needs or emerging trends by asking questions that others have not thought of.

## In Scientific Research: The Importance of the Question

Every researcher knows that **a well-posed question is the heart of any study**. In science, formulating a research question or hypothesis is a skill that often determines the success of a project. The Nobel laureate scientist **Albert Einstein** reputedly remarked, &quot;If I had an hour to solve a problem... I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I can solve the problem in less than five minutes.&quot; ([The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network](https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/)). Whether or not the timing is literal, the message is clear: **understanding what to ask is more crucial than rushing to find answers**.

The history of science is full of paradigm-shifting questions. For example, instead of asking &quot;How do planets move?&quot;, Copernicus asked &quot;What if the Earth is not the center of the universe?&quot;, leading to a heliocentric model. In biology, instead of simply cataloging species, Darwin asked &quot;How do species originate?&quot;, leading to the theory of evolution. These were costly questions in the sense that they challenged deep-set beliefs and required years (or decades) of inquiry to answer, but they unlocked tremendous knowledge.

Researchers also recognize that **every answer generates new questions**. A published result often ends with suggestions for &quot;further questions to investigate,&quot; acknowledging that knowledge is an open-ended journey. As Kevin Kelly observed, &quot;Every answer we uncover yields at least two brand new questions&quot; ([Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions](https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/)). This means our collective ignorance actually grows even as knowledge grows - which is why framing new questions is an ever-ongoing task in research ([Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions](https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/)).

Thus in research, **the &#039;costly&#039; part is identifying the right problem or question**. It often takes insight and creativity - the hallmarks of scientific genius - to see the question that no one else is asking. Once the question is clear, standard methods can often find the answer. That is why universities and labs emphasize training students how to think critically and ask questions, not just memorize answers. The nature of knowledge is such that **answers are transient, but inquiry is permanent** - today&#039;s answers will lead to tomorrow&#039;s inquiries.

## In Education and Learning: Cultivating Curiosity

Education is not just about transferring answers from teacher to student; it is fundamentally about **teaching students how to question and learn**. A good educator, like Socrates, acts less like an answer-key and more like a guide who provokes students with questions. The Socratic method is still used in classrooms to develop critical thinking: the teacher asks a series of questions, leading students to examine their assumptions and arrive at answers themselves ([Socratic Questioning in Psychology: Examples and Techniques](https://positivepsychology.com/socratic-questioning/)). This process shows students *how* to think rather than *what* to think. As one educational author put it, &quot;There are no dumb questions.&quot; While that might be a slight idealization (we have all heard trivial questions), the intent is to **encourage inquiry** - because asking is how we learn ([Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions](https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/)).

Children naturally bombard the world with questions (&quot;Why is the sky blue? Why not? How does this work?&quot;). This innate curiosity is how humans begin to understand their environment. **Great educators aim to keep that flame of curiosity alive**, knowing that a student who asks questions is actively engaging with the material. In contrast, rote learning (memorizing answers) produces shallow understanding. Educational research supports that **students develop higher-order thinking when they grapple with questions and problems**, not just passively receive information ([The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network](https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/)). By formulating questions, students learn to make connections, identify gaps in their knowledge, and pursue deeper comprehension ([Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions](https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/)).

In the context of Dediu&#039;s statement, one can interpret that &quot;answers are free&quot; in education because facts and answers can be delivered (through textbooks, lectures, or now the internet) relatively easily. But &quot;questions will cost you&quot; because to truly educate - to draw out a student&#039;s ability to think and question - requires skilled teachers, effort, and often an environment that supports curiosity. The **cost** of a good question in education is the work a student puts into thinking. It might also reflect that true understanding (wisdom) cannot simply be handed over; the learner must actively participate by questioning. Ultimately, the goal of education is to produce independent thinkers who know how to approach any new problem by asking insightful questions. That skill will serve them far beyond any specific answer memorized for a test.

## In Technology and the Age of AI: Questions as the New Asset

[A sign with a question mark and a question mark drawn on it](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-sign-with-a-question-mark-and-a-question-mark-drawn-on-it-OAsF0QMRWlA) *The rise of AI and large language models means answers are abundant - prompting a new focus on **asking the right questions**.* In today&#039;s world, technology has made answers **instantaneous and ubiquitous**. With a quick search on Google or a query to a virtual assistant, we can retrieve facts and answers to countless questions in seconds. More recently, powerful LLMs like ChatGPT can generate paragraphs of answers, solutions, or explanations on almost any topic for free or minimal cost. We truly live in an age where **&quot;answers are cheap.&quot;** Tech visionary Kevin Kelly noted that as we build machines (like search engines and AI) that deliver endless answers, &quot;while answers become cheap, our questions become valuable&quot; ([Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions](https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/)). This is a reversal of the past, when finding answers was hard and asking questions was easy. Now we have &quot;answer machines,&quot; and the bottleneck is our ability to ask good questions ([Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions](https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/)).

In the realm of AI, there is a growing recognition that **the quality of output from an AI system depends on the quality of the input query or prompt**. This has given rise to the idea of &quot;prompt engineering,&quot; which is essentially the craft of asking an AI the right questions in the right way to get a useful answer. The AI can supply an infinite amount of text (free answers), but only a well-posed prompt yields something truly valuable. As one commentator observed, &quot;There is an asymmetry in the work needed to generate a good question versus the work needed to absorb an answer. While the answer machine can expand instant answers infinitely, our time to form the next question is very limited.&quot; ([Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions](https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/)). In other words, **human attention and insight are now the scarce resources, not information**.

This dynamic is making Dediu&#039;s statement more literal. Companies are beginning to **seek employees who excel at asking insightful questions** in data analysis, AI usage, and strategy, because those people can leverage technology far better. One tech CEO noted that with modern AI, &quot;The answers are free; the questions you got to pay for. And so who is good at asking questions is the skill to interview for.&quot; ([How CEOs Build with AI - Sean Devine of XBE - Eric Jorgenson](https://www.ejorgenson.com/podcast/sean-devine)). This highlights that in an AI-rich environment, the *human* contribution is to provide direction - to know what problems to solve and which questions to ask the machine. An AI can churn out countless answers, but it takes human judgment to decide which questions even need answering and to interpret the results.

Kevin Kelly even envisions a future &quot;question economy&quot; where &quot;humans will be paid to ask questions&quot; as opposed to finding answers ([The Technium: When Answers Are Cheap](https://kk.org/thetechnium/when-answers-ar/)). He suggests that business schools will focus on training managers to ask great questions since factual answers will be automated ([The Technium: When Answers Are Cheap](https://kk.org/thetechnium/when-answers-ar/)). Scientists, too, will be lauded more for the questions they explore than the answers they obtain ([The Technium: When Answers Are Cheap](https://kk.org/thetechnium/when-answers-ar/)). In such a future, Dediu&#039;s witty statement could become an actual market reality: **answers (even correct ones) may be cheap commodities, while a truly original or penetrating question could be worth a fortune** ([The Technium: When Answers Are Cheap](https://kk.org/thetechnium/when-answers-ar/)). Imagine a scenario where a single brilliant question leads to a major innovation or discovery - that question might be &quot;worth&quot; more than a thousand routine answers.

Even today, this shift is apparent. AI can pass exams, write code, and draft essays - effectively providing free answers to many standard questions. This challenges us to raise our game: to ask **deeper, non-obvious questions** that AI cannot easily handle, such as those involving ethical judgments, strategic foresight, or fundamentally new ideas. It puts a premium on human creativity and critical thinking. Thus, in the age of LLMs, **the ability to ask meaningful, insightful, and strategic questions is the new competitive advantage**, whether in technology, business, or personal growth. Dediu&#039;s witty statement has become a practical guideline: cultivate great questions, because answers alone no longer distinguish us (machines can handle those).

## The Cost of Wisdom and the Future of Inquiry

Dediu&#039;s aphorism points to a timeless truth: **wisdom must be earned**, and the currency is questions. Throughout history, wise individuals have been those unafraid to ask &quot;why?&quot; and &quot;what if?&quot;, even when answers were not readily available or convenient. In our modern context, where answers are everywhere, the role of inquiry is even more critical. The *cost* of wisdom is not measured in money, but in the willingness to embrace uncertainty, invest time in thinking, and possibly challenge the conventional answers. It requires the humility to admit what we do not know and the courage to ask questions that might upend our current understanding.

As we move forward, across industries and disciplines, it will be those who **ask better questions** who push boundaries. In business, they will identify new opportunities and strategies. In science, they will open new research frontiers. In education, they will foster empowered learners. In technology, they will ensure that our tools are used to solve meaningful problems rather than trivial ones. Even in daily life, thoughtful questions can lead to personal growth and better decisions (for example, asking &quot;What truly makes me fulfilled?&quot; instead of accepting society&#039;s ready-made answers about success).

In conclusion, Horace Dediu&#039;s statement serves as a reminder that **knowledge is not just about having answers on hand - it is about knowing what to ask in the first place**. In an era where large language models can spew endless answers for free, the real intellectual labor - and value - lies in posing the questions that matter. Answers may be cheap, but questions, like wisdom, are priceless. By cherishing curiosity and the spirit of inquiry, we carry forward the legacy of human progress. After all, every great advance begins not with an answer, but with a great question.

For Socrates, an unexamined life - one where we fail to question our own beliefs - was not worth living (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living">The unexamined life is not worth living - Wikipedia</a>). His legacy shows that <strong>wisdom is not about memorizing answers, but about probing deeper with questions</strong>. This idea reverberates through time: <strong>Voltaire</strong>, for example, advised &quot;Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.&quot; (<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/voltaire_100338">Voltaire - Judge a man by his questions rather than his...</a>). A person&#39;s questions reveal their curiosity, critical thinking, and insight, whereas answers often simply recite known facts. Anthropologist <strong>Claude Levi-Strauss</strong> put it succinctly: &quot;The wise man doesn&#39;t give the right answers, he poses the right questions.&quot; (<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/claude_levistrauss_137171">Claude Levi-Strauss - The wise man doesn&#39;t give the right...</a>).</p>
<p>These historical perspectives highlight a key philosophical point: <strong>knowledge is not a static set of answers, but a dynamic process of inquiry</strong>. Every answer, no matter how correct, eventually leads to new questions - a &quot;paradox of science&quot; noted by futurist Kevin Kelly (<a href="https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/">Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions</a>). Our understanding of the world expands by continuously questioning it. In essence, <strong>questions have always been the driving force of wisdom and human progress</strong>, while answers are stepping stones along the way.</p>
<h2 id="from-knowledge-to-wisdom-the-cost-of-insight">From Knowledge to Wisdom: The Cost of Insight</h2>
<p>Why are good questions &quot;costly&quot; in Dediu&#39;s sense? Philosophically, it is because <strong>insightful questions require deeper understanding and creativity</strong>. Anyone can recall or look up an answer, but it takes <strong>wisdom, experience, and often courage to ask a truly important question</strong>. A good question might challenge assumptions or open new realms of knowledge - and formulating it can be hard work. This is the &quot;cost&quot; of questions: the intellectual effort and intuition needed to pose them. History shows that those who asked bold questions often paid a price for their insights. Socrates&#39; relentless questioning of Athenian society ultimately cost him his life, and many scientific pioneers (like Galileo or Darwin) faced persecution or ridicule for questioning orthodox views. <strong>Inquiry has a cost, but it is the currency of progress.</strong></p>
<p>There is also an economic metaphor in Dediu&#39;s statement: answers are a commodity, but questions are a service or skill one might pay for. This rings true in fields like consulting or coaching - a consultant&#39;s value is often in diagnosing problems and asking the right strategic questions, rather than just handing out answers. Crafting a powerful question is akin to unlocking a door: it can lead to valuable discoveries or solutions. As the management legend <strong>Peter Drucker</strong> noted, &quot;The most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers... the truly dangerous thing is asking the wrong questions.&quot; In other words, <strong>the quality of our answers depends on the quality of our questions</strong>, and finding the right question is more than half the battle (<a href="https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/">The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network</a>).</p>
<p>Not all questions are equal. Thoughtless or &quot;dumb&quot; questions yield trivial or useless answers, whereas <strong>thoughtful questions yield insight</strong> (<a href="https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/">Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions</a>). Formulating a good question requires understanding context, knowing what information is missing, and sometimes thinking creatively or laterally. This is why good questions feel &quot;costly&quot; - they often emerge from extensive knowledge or hard-won experience. It is said that <strong>knowledge is having the right answer, but intelligence (or wisdom) is asking the right question</strong>. In this light, Dediu&#39;s phrase encapsulates the idea that <strong>wisdom cannot be given away easily</strong>; it must be earned through inquiry. Answers might be free, but wisdom - the ability to ask the questions that lead to truth - is invaluable.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-inquiry-in-human-progress">The Role of Inquiry in Human Progress</h2>
<p><strong>Human progress is driven by questions.</strong> Every significant advancement began with someone asking &quot;What if...&quot; or &quot;Why not...&quot; or &quot;How can we improve this?&quot; From the scientific revolution to social reforms, it was the bold questions that challenged the status quo and led to new knowledge. For instance, Newton famously asked why an apple falls down - a simple question that led to formulating the laws of gravity. The innovators and explorers of the Age of Discovery wondered what lay beyond known maps. In philosophy and art, questioning accepted norms gave rise to new schools of thought and creativity.</p>
<p>Crucially, a <strong>good question can illuminate problems and opportunities that were previously unseen</strong>. It is often observed in science that &quot;the question matters more than the answer.&quot; A well-framed research question guides the entire investigation and can yield breakthroughs, whereas a poorly framed question leads nowhere. <strong>Carl Jung</strong> once said, &quot;The right question is already half the solution to a problem.&quot; (<a href="https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/">The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network</a>). Similarly, engineer and inventor <strong>Charles Kettering</strong> advised that &quot;a problem well-stated is a problem half-solved.&quot; When we identify the right question, the answers tend to fall into place.</p>
<p>Thus, inquiry is not just a philosophical nicety - it has practical power. It is how humans have <em>invented, discovered,</em> and <em>innovated.</em> Every answer we possess today (in science, technology, etc.) exists because someone asked a question that had not been answered before. In this sense, <strong>questions are the engines of discovery</strong>, and nurturing the ability to question is essential for continued progress.</p>
<h2 id="in-business-and-strategy-asking-over-answering">In Business and Strategy: Asking Over Answering</h2>
<p>In the business world, Dediu&#39;s insight is especially apt. Modern businesses value leaders and strategists who can <strong>ask the right questions about markets, products, and internal processes</strong>. Answers (like data and reports) are readily available, but knowing &quot;which questions to pursue&quot; can set a company apart. For example, a company might have tons of data (answers), but a strategist will ask, &quot;What do our customers truly need that no one is providing?&quot; or &quot;Why are we losing market share in this segment?&quot; These incisive questions can spark strategic shifts or innovations. Legendary IBM CEO Thomas Watson said, &quot;The ability to ask the right question is more than half the battle of finding the answer.&quot; (<a href="https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/">The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network</a>). Likewise, quality guru <strong>W. Edwards Deming</strong> warned, &quot;If you do not know how to ask the right question, you discover nothing.&quot; (<a href="https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/">The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network</a>).</p>
<p>Business consultants often exemplify Dediu&#39;s maxim. A consultant&#39;s <strong>answers</strong> (recommendations) might be freely available in books or blogs, but companies hire consultants for their ability to <strong>diagnose the situation and pose critical questions</strong> that internal teams overlooked. Dediu himself, as an industry analyst, likely meant that he can give out answers or facts for free (say, via articles or tweets), but if you want him to analyze your business and &quot;figure out what questions you should be asking,&quot; that expert insight will cost you. In other words, <strong>the real value in consulting or analysis lies in framing the problem - asking the high-value questions - rather than just dispensing facts</strong>.</p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>innovation in business thrives on questioning assumptions</strong>. Companies like Toyota famously use the &quot;5 Whys&quot; technique - asking &quot;why?&quot; repeatedly to drill down to root causes of problems. This shows that systematically asking questions can lead to profound improvements. In entrepreneurial circles, it is said that finding the right problem to solve (a question) is as important as the solution. The <strong>competitive advantage</strong> often goes to those who can identify unmet needs or emerging trends by asking questions that others have not thought of.</p>
<h2 id="in-scientific-research-the-importance-of-the-question">In Scientific Research: The Importance of the Question</h2>
<p>Every researcher knows that <strong>a well-posed question is the heart of any study</strong>. In science, formulating a research question or hypothesis is a skill that often determines the success of a project. The Nobel laureate scientist <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> reputedly remarked, &quot;If I had an hour to solve a problem... I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I can solve the problem in less than five minutes.&quot; (<a href="https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/">The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network</a>). Whether or not the timing is literal, the message is clear: <strong>understanding what to ask is more crucial than rushing to find answers</strong>.</p>
<p>The history of science is full of paradigm-shifting questions. For example, instead of asking &quot;How do planets move?&quot;, Copernicus asked &quot;What if the Earth is not the center of the universe?&quot;, leading to a heliocentric model. In biology, instead of simply cataloging species, Darwin asked &quot;How do species originate?&quot;, leading to the theory of evolution. These were costly questions in the sense that they challenged deep-set beliefs and required years (or decades) of inquiry to answer, but they unlocked tremendous knowledge.</p>
<p>Researchers also recognize that <strong>every answer generates new questions</strong>. A published result often ends with suggestions for &quot;further questions to investigate,&quot; acknowledging that knowledge is an open-ended journey. As Kevin Kelly observed, &quot;Every answer we uncover yields at least two brand new questions&quot; (<a href="https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/">Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions</a>). This means our collective ignorance actually grows even as knowledge grows - which is why framing new questions is an ever-ongoing task in research (<a href="https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/">Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions</a>).</p>
<p>Thus in research, <strong>the &#39;costly&#39; part is identifying the right problem or question</strong>. It often takes insight and creativity - the hallmarks of scientific genius - to see the question that no one else is asking. Once the question is clear, standard methods can often find the answer. That is why universities and labs emphasize training students how to think critically and ask questions, not just memorize answers. The nature of knowledge is such that <strong>answers are transient, but inquiry is permanent</strong> - today&#39;s answers will lead to tomorrow&#39;s inquiries.</p>
<h2 id="in-education-and-learning-cultivating-curiosity">In Education and Learning: Cultivating Curiosity</h2>
<p>Education is not just about transferring answers from teacher to student; it is fundamentally about <strong>teaching students how to question and learn</strong>. A good educator, like Socrates, acts less like an answer-key and more like a guide who provokes students with questions. The Socratic method is still used in classrooms to develop critical thinking: the teacher asks a series of questions, leading students to examine their assumptions and arrive at answers themselves (<a href="https://positivepsychology.com/socratic-questioning/">Socratic Questioning in Psychology: Examples and Techniques</a>). This process shows students <em>how</em> to think rather than <em>what</em> to think. As one educational author put it, &quot;There are no dumb questions.&quot; While that might be a slight idealization (we have all heard trivial questions), the intent is to <strong>encourage inquiry</strong> - because asking is how we learn (<a href="https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/">Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions</a>).</p>
<p>Children naturally bombard the world with questions (&quot;Why is the sky blue? Why not? How does this work?&quot;). This innate curiosity is how humans begin to understand their environment. <strong>Great educators aim to keep that flame of curiosity alive</strong>, knowing that a student who asks questions is actively engaging with the material. In contrast, rote learning (memorizing answers) produces shallow understanding. Educational research supports that <strong>students develop higher-order thinking when they grapple with questions and problems</strong>, not just passively receive information (<a href="https://performanceexcellencenetwork.org/pensights/the-power-of-why-how-asking-the-right-questions-can-change-everything-july-2024/">The Power of Why: How Asking the Right Questions Can Change Everything - July 2024 - Performance Excellence Network</a>). By formulating questions, students learn to make connections, identify gaps in their knowledge, and pursue deeper comprehension (<a href="https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/">Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions</a>).</p>
<p>In the context of Dediu&#39;s statement, one can interpret that &quot;answers are free&quot; in education because facts and answers can be delivered (through textbooks, lectures, or now the internet) relatively easily. But &quot;questions will cost you&quot; because to truly educate - to draw out a student&#39;s ability to think and question - requires skilled teachers, effort, and often an environment that supports curiosity. The <strong>cost</strong> of a good question in education is the work a student puts into thinking. It might also reflect that true understanding (wisdom) cannot simply be handed over; the learner must actively participate by questioning. Ultimately, the goal of education is to produce independent thinkers who know how to approach any new problem by asking insightful questions. That skill will serve them far beyond any specific answer memorized for a test.</p>
<h2 id="in-technology-and-the-age-of-ai-questions-as-the-new-asset">In Technology and the Age of AI: Questions as the New Asset</h2>
<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-sign-with-a-question-mark-and-a-question-mark-drawn-on-it-OAsF0QMRWlA">A sign with a question mark and a question mark drawn on it</a> <em>The rise of AI and large language models means answers are abundant - prompting a new focus on <strong>asking the right questions</strong>.</em> In today&#39;s world, technology has made answers <strong>instantaneous and ubiquitous</strong>. With a quick search on Google or a query to a virtual assistant, we can retrieve facts and answers to countless questions in seconds. More recently, powerful LLMs like ChatGPT can generate paragraphs of answers, solutions, or explanations on almost any topic for free or minimal cost. We truly live in an age where <strong>&quot;answers are cheap.&quot;</strong> Tech visionary Kevin Kelly noted that as we build machines (like search engines and AI) that deliver endless answers, &quot;while answers become cheap, our questions become valuable&quot; (<a href="https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/">Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions</a>). This is a reversal of the past, when finding answers was hard and asking questions was easy. Now we have &quot;answer machines,&quot; and the bottleneck is our ability to ask good questions (<a href="https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/">Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions</a>).</p>
<p>In the realm of AI, there is a growing recognition that <strong>the quality of output from an AI system depends on the quality of the input query or prompt</strong>. This has given rise to the idea of &quot;prompt engineering,&quot; which is essentially the craft of asking an AI the right questions in the right way to get a useful answer. The AI can supply an infinite amount of text (free answers), but only a well-posed prompt yields something truly valuable. As one commentator observed, &quot;There is an asymmetry in the work needed to generate a good question versus the work needed to absorb an answer. While the answer machine can expand instant answers infinitely, our time to form the next question is very limited.&quot; (<a href="https://enterrasolutions.com/artificial-intelligence-increases-importance-questions/">Artificial Intelligence Increases the Importance of Questions - Enterra Solutions</a>). In other words, <strong>human attention and insight are now the scarce resources, not information</strong>.</p>
<p>This dynamic is making Dediu&#39;s statement more literal. Companies are beginning to <strong>seek employees who excel at asking insightful questions</strong> in data analysis, AI usage, and strategy, because those people can leverage technology far better. One tech CEO noted that with modern AI, &quot;The answers are free; the questions you got to pay for. And so who is good at asking questions is the skill to interview for.&quot; (<a href="https://www.ejorgenson.com/podcast/sean-devine">How CEOs Build with AI - Sean Devine of XBE - Eric Jorgenson</a>). This highlights that in an AI-rich environment, the <em>human</em> contribution is to provide direction - to know what problems to solve and which questions to ask the machine. An AI can churn out countless answers, but it takes human judgment to decide which questions even need answering and to interpret the results.</p>
<p>Kevin Kelly even envisions a future &quot;question economy&quot; where &quot;humans will be paid to ask questions&quot; as opposed to finding answers (<a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/when-answers-ar/">The Technium: When Answers Are Cheap</a>). He suggests that business schools will focus on training managers to ask great questions since factual answers will be automated (<a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/when-answers-ar/">The Technium: When Answers Are Cheap</a>). Scientists, too, will be lauded more for the questions they explore than the answers they obtain (<a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/when-answers-ar/">The Technium: When Answers Are Cheap</a>). In such a future, Dediu&#39;s witty statement could become an actual market reality: <strong>answers (even correct ones) may be cheap commodities, while a truly original or penetrating question could be worth a fortune</strong> (<a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/when-answers-ar/">The Technium: When Answers Are Cheap</a>). Imagine a scenario where a single brilliant question leads to a major innovation or discovery - that question might be &quot;worth&quot; more than a thousand routine answers.</p>
<p>Even today, this shift is apparent. AI can pass exams, write code, and draft essays - effectively providing free answers to many standard questions. This challenges us to raise our game: to ask <strong>deeper, non-obvious questions</strong> that AI cannot easily handle, such as those involving ethical judgments, strategic foresight, or fundamentally new ideas. It puts a premium on human creativity and critical thinking. Thus, in the age of LLMs, <strong>the ability to ask meaningful, insightful, and strategic questions is the new competitive advantage</strong>, whether in technology, business, or personal growth. Dediu&#39;s witty statement has become a practical guideline: cultivate great questions, because answers alone no longer distinguish us (machines can handle those).</p>
<h2 id="the-cost-of-wisdom-and-the-future-of-inquiry">The Cost of Wisdom and the Future of Inquiry</h2>
<p>Dediu&#39;s aphorism points to a timeless truth: <strong>wisdom must be earned</strong>, and the currency is questions. Throughout history, wise individuals have been those unafraid to ask &quot;why?&quot; and &quot;what if?&quot;, even when answers were not readily available or convenient. In our modern context, where answers are everywhere, the role of inquiry is even more critical. The <em>cost</em> of wisdom is not measured in money, but in the willingness to embrace uncertainty, invest time in thinking, and possibly challenge the conventional answers. It requires the humility to admit what we do not know and the courage to ask questions that might upend our current understanding.</p>
<p>As we move forward, across industries and disciplines, it will be those who <strong>ask better questions</strong> who push boundaries. In business, they will identify new opportunities and strategies. In science, they will open new research frontiers. In education, they will foster empowered learners. In technology, they will ensure that our tools are used to solve meaningful problems rather than trivial ones. Even in daily life, thoughtful questions can lead to personal growth and better decisions (for example, asking &quot;What truly makes me fulfilled?&quot; instead of accepting society&#39;s ready-made answers about success).</p>
<p>In conclusion, Horace Dediu&#39;s statement serves as a reminder that <strong>knowledge is not just about having answers on hand - it is about knowing what to ask in the first place</strong>. In an era where large language models can spew endless answers for free, the real intellectual labor - and value - lies in posing the questions that matter. Answers may be cheap, but questions, like wisdom, are priceless. By cherishing curiosity and the spirit of inquiry, we carry forward the legacy of human progress. After all, every great advance begins not with an answer, but with a great question.</p>
