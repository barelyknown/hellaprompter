For example, a violation of this policy would be getting drunk with prospective customers (little upside, but high uncertain downside). Research the related ideas of Taleb and other related authors and thinkers. Reduce it down to a simple set of guidelines for team members.",

    "\"If the decision risks the company’s survival or reputation for a trivial gain, it’s concave. (Never bet the firm for a small reward.)\"",
    "\"In other words: “Make sure that the probability of the unacceptable (risk of ruin) is nil.” ([Principles by Ray Dalio])\"",
    "\"Anything that has more upside than downside from random events is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.\"",
    "\"Our policy formalizes prudent risk limits: we do not gamble the company’s future on single shots.\"",
    "\"Our company has thrived by delivering reliable software and earning trust; one misstep with catastrophic downside can undo years of goodwill.\""

  "sceneDescription": "A lone executive stands in a pristine conference room, balancing a delicate set of scales on a polished tabletop. On one side, a tiny token, barely tipping the scale. On the other side, a borderless, looming weight teetering ominously. In the background, serene corporate artwork contrasts with the executive’s worried expression. A second figure, perhaps an anxious colleague, peeks in through the doorway. Subtle signs of corporate life—a briefcase, a tidy presentation board—frame the moment, hinting that a seemingly small decision could unleash a disproportionately large risk.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "2. The illustration effectively captures the essence of decision-making with an executive balancing scales, visibly depicting the concept of concave decisions. It is characteristic of The New Yorker style, with subtle humor through the exaggerated loom of the weight and the expression of concern. The visual clarity, composition, and sophistication of the humor make it a strong match for the article's theme.",
