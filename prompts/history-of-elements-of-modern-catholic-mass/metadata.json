  "sceneDescription": "A single, candlelit aisle stretches toward a simple altar. At the front, a solemn priest in contemporary vestments lifts a chalice, while behind him, a neat line of priests from various centuries waits: one in early Christian robes, another in richly embroidered Renaissance attire, another in post-Vatican II simplicity.
