<p>Goa&#39;s iron ore mining industry has traversed a dramatic journey - from its quiet early days under Portuguese rule to becoming a key export sector, and then facing shutdowns amid legal battles and environmental concerns. This report chronicles the history of iron ore mining in Goa, highlighting major phases such as the Portuguese era, the post-1961 transition, the China-driven boom, the investigations into illegal mining, landmark court judgments, and the recent shift to auction-based mining. The narrative is structured chronologically, combining factual detail with the unfolding legal saga, and is supported by citations for verification.</p>
<h2 id="early-mining-in-goa">Early Mining in Goa</h2>
<p>Reports suggest that mineral deposits in Goa were known for centuries. Local legends even mention Jain residents extracting gold in ancient times (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/history-of-mining-in-goa/">History of Mining in Goa - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). However, iron ore extraction remained limited until the late 19th and early 20th century. The first documented mining concession in Goa was granted in <strong>1905</strong> to a businessman from Constantinople (Istanbul), marking the modest beginning of Goa&#39;s mining industry (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/history-of-mining-in-goa/">History of Mining in Goa - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). A few years later, in <strong>1910</strong>, a French company attempted to mine manganese in Goa, planning a railway to transport ore, though large-scale operations did not immediately follow (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/history-of-mining-in-goa/">History of Mining in Goa - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>).</p>
<p>Significant mining activity in Goa began in the mid-20th century. In <strong>1929</strong>, under Portuguese colonial law, the first official mining lease (concession) was granted (<a href="https://goamining.org/mining_in_goa/history-timeline.php">History Timeline</a>). By the <strong>1940s</strong>, enterprising Goan families and companies started mining iron and manganese ore on a larger scale. Notably, a test shipment of Goan iron ore was sent to Japan in <strong>1939</strong> under the supervision of Vishwasrao Chowgule, a pioneer of Goa&#39;s mining industry (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugal-turns-to-mining-to-boost-economy/articleshow/18622575.cms">Portuguese Authorities In Goa: Portugal turns to mining to boost economy | Goa News - Times of India</a>). This proved that Goan ore could find international markets, setting the stage for an export-oriented industry.</p>
<h2 id="the-portuguese-era-1940s-1961">The Portuguese Era (1940s-1961)</h2>
<p>After World War II, mining in Goa accelerated rapidly. The Portuguese colonial government, which still ruled Goa until 1961, actively encouraged mining to boost the territory&#39;s economy (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugal-turns-to-mining-to-boost-economy/articleshow/18622575.cms">Portuguese Authorities In Goa: Portugal turns to mining to boost economy | Goa News - Times of India</a>). One reason was to demonstrate that Goans could enjoy a higher standard of living under Portuguese rule than Indians did in independent India (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugal-turns-to-mining-to-boost-economy/articleshow/18622575.cms">Portuguese Authorities In Goa: Portugal turns to mining to boost economy | Goa News - Times of India</a>). Throughout the 1950s, the colonial administration issued mining concessions liberally. In <strong>1947</strong> (the year India became independent, though Goa was still Portuguese), 17 mining leases were in operation; this number grew to 42 by 1950 (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugal-turns-to-mining-to-boost-economy/articleshow/18622575.cms">Portuguese Authorities In Goa: Portugal turns to mining to boost economy | Goa News - Times of India</a>). By <strong>1953</strong>, there were 144 active mining leases, and mechanized mining techniques were introduced around this time to increase production (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugal-turns-to-mining-to-boost-economy/articleshow/18622575.cms">Portuguese Authorities In Goa: Portugal turns to mining to boost economy | Goa News - Times of India</a>) (<a href="https://goamining.org/mining_in_goa/history-timeline.php">History Timeline</a>).</p>
<p>Goa&#39;s iron ore output surged in the late 1950s. The 1955 economic blockade imposed by India (to pressure Portugal to relinquish Goa) ironically pushed the Portuguese to intensify mining as an alternate revenue source (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugal-turns-to-mining-to-boost-economy/articleshow/18622575.cms">Portuguese Authorities In Goa: Portugal turns to mining to boost economy | Goa News - Times of India</a>). In the single year <strong>1960</strong>, an astonishing 596 new mining leases were granted in Goa (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugal-turns-to-mining-to-boost-economy/articleshow/18622575.cms">Portuguese Authorities In Goa: Portugal turns to mining to boost economy | Goa News - Times of India</a>). By the time Goa was liberated from Portuguese rule in December <strong>1961</strong>, over <strong>700</strong> mining concessions had been sanctioned in total (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugal-turns-to-mining-to-boost-economy/articleshow/18622575.cms">Portuguese Authorities In Goa: Portugal turns to mining to boost economy | Goa News - Times of India</a>). Iron ore exports had swelled to about <strong>6.5 million tonnes per year</strong> by 1961 (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/portugal-turns-to-mining-to-boost-economy/articleshow/18622575.cms">Portuguese Authorities In Goa: Portugal turns to mining to boost economy | Goa News - Times of India</a>), with Japan and Western Europe being major buyers of Goa&#39;s low-grade iron ore. Mining had transformed from a minor activity into a cornerstone of Goa&#39;s economy during the Portuguese era. This rapid expansion, however, set the stage for future challenges in regulating the sector.</p>
<h2 id="post-liberation-changes-1961-1987">Post-Liberation Changes (1961-1987)</h2>
<p>When India annexed Goa in December 1961, the thousands of existing Portuguese mining concessions posed a legal and administrative challenge. For a time, the mines continued operating under the old concession system even as Goa became an Indian territory. The Indian government gradually moved to bring Goa&#39;s mining under national mining laws. A crucial reform came with the Goa, Daman and Diu Mining Concessions (Abolition and Declaration as Mining Leases) Act, 1987, enacted on 23 May 1987 (<a href="https://goamining.org/mining_in_goa/history-timeline.php">History Timeline</a>). This law abolished the Portuguese-era perpetual concessions and converted them into fixed-term mining leases under India&#39;s legal framework (<a href="https://goamining.org/mining_in_goa/history-timeline.php">History Timeline</a>). Under the Act, all former concessions were deemed to be mining leases effective from the date of Goa&#39;s liberation, with a 20-year lease period (retroactively 1961-1981, later extended to 2007) (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). The erstwhile concession-holders were compensated by the government, and from 1987 onward the &quot;plethora of Indian laws&quot; - including environmental and labor regulations - fully applied to mining operations in Goa (<a href="https://goamining.org/mining_in_goa/history-timeline.php">History Timeline</a>).</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, as Goa integrated with India, its mining industry continued, though it experienced cycles of boom and bust. The first two decades after liberation saw infrastructure improvements - for example, companies like Chowgule and Salgaocar mechanized mining processes, built barges and transshipment facilities, and even set up India&#39;s first iron ore pelletization plant in Goa in 1967 (<a href="https://goamining.org/mining_in_goa/history-timeline.php">History Timeline</a>). By the late 1970s, however, global iron ore demand dipped, leading to a <strong>bust cycle</strong>. Many mines became barely profitable in the late 1970s, and again in the early 1990s, when another downturn hit (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/history-of-mining-in-goa/">History of Mining in Goa - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). During these lean periods, some mining operators allegedly began cutting corners to save costs, giving rise to <strong>questionable practices</strong> in mining and exports (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/history-of-mining-in-goa/">History of Mining in Goa - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). It is likely that illegal mining practices - such as under-reporting of production or encroachment beyond lease areas - took root during these hard times (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/history-of-mining-in-goa/">History of Mining in Goa - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>).</p>
<p>Despite the downturns, mining remained an important livelihood for thousands of Goans. By the mid-1980s, the industry had recovered somewhat, only to face the regulatory upheaval of the 1987 Act. Many mine owners legally challenged the Act&#39;s provisions (arguing against the termination of their perpetual rights), and some of those disputes lingered in courts for years (<a href="https://goamining.org/mining_in_goa/history-timeline.php">History Timeline</a>). Nonetheless, mining operations continued under the new regime. By the end of the 1990s, with global commodity markets rebounding, Goa&#39;s miners were poised for another boom - one that would soon be fueled by unprecedented demand from China.</p>
<h2 id="the-china-commodity-boom-2000s">The China Commodity Boom (2000s)</h2>
<p>The early 2000s brought a <strong>commodity super-cycle</strong>, driven largely by China&#39;s rapid industrial growth. Iron ore prices and demand soared worldwide, and Goa - with its low-grade iron ore in abundant supply - found itself at the center of a lucrative export rush. Around <strong>2003-2004</strong>, Chinese steel mills began importing huge quantities of iron ore, including lower-grade ore that earlier might have been considered waste. Goa&#39;s miners responded to the opportunity with a <strong>&quot;mad rush&quot; to extract as much ore as possible and ship it to China</strong> (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/history-of-mining-in-goa/">History of Mining in Goa - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). Iron ore production in Goa skyrocketed - from just about 5 million tonnes in the late 1990s to over <strong>45 million tonnes by 2010</strong> (peaking around 2007-2012). Almost <strong>99% of Goa&#39;s iron ore</strong> was exported (mainly to China), since the local Indian steel industry preferred higher-grade ore from other regions (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>) (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). By <strong>2010-11</strong>, mining contributed roughly <strong>20% of Goa&#39;s Gross State Domestic Product</strong>, underlining its central role in the state&#39;s economy (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>However, this breakneck expansion came at <strong>tremendous environmental and social cost</strong>. Unregulated and illegal activities became commonplace during the boom. There were frequent reports of mines expanding into forest areas without permits, extracting beyond approved quantities, and dumping waste soil into rivers and fields. The transportation of ore by thousands of truck trips and barges led to pollution and public health concerns. Malpractices were <em>&quot;commonplace&quot;</em> - as one account noted, the boom period was accompanied by widespread violations of law in collusion with authorities (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/history-of-mining-in-goa/">History of Mining in Goa - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). Local communities and activists grew alarmed at the environmental degradation: agricultural productivity fell in mining zones, water sources were contaminated by silt, and the once-tranquil villages of Goa&#39;s interior experienced noise, dust, and disruption.</p>
<p>Starting in the late 2000s, a series of Public Interest Litigations (PILs) were filed in courts, and some mines were shut down temporarily on grounds ranging from lack of environmental clearance to encroachment on government land (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/history-of-mining-in-goa/">History of Mining in Goa - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). These piecemeal actions, however, did little to halt the overall frenzy. The tipping point came when the Indian central government appointed a <strong>Commission of Inquiry</strong> headed by Justice M.B. Shah in 2010 to investigate illegal mining in several states, including Goa. As the commission undertook its fact-finding (collecting data on mining leases, exports, and compliance), it became evident that Goa&#39;s mining boom was a textbook case of <strong>&quot;unrestricted, unchecked and unregulated&quot;</strong> mining, enabled by systemic corruption (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). The stage was set for a major reckoning.</p>
<h2 id="shah-commission-report-and-the-2012-ban">Shah Commission Report and the 2012 Ban</h2>
<p>In September <strong>2012</strong>, the Justice M.B. Shah Commission&#39;s report on Goa&#39;s mining was tabled in the Indian Parliament - and its findings were explosive. The Shah Commission estimated that the <strong>&quot;iron ore mining scam&quot; in Goa was worth about Rs 35,000 crore</strong> (roughly USD 5 billion) in losses to the public exchequer (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>) (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). This staggering figure represented the value of illegally mined ore exported from 2006 to 2011, calculated using average international prices (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). The report documented <strong>multiple grave violations</strong> by mining companies and government agencies alike: mining outside lease boundaries (encroaching into 578 hectares of land, including forest and public lands), excessive extraction beyond permissible limits, evasion of royalties, and outright illegal mining in areas with no valid lease (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>) (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). It accused Goa&#39;s Department of Mines, the Indian Bureau of Mines, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), the State Pollution Control Board, and even local forest officials of turning a blind eye to - or in some cases facilitating - the rampant illegalities (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>) (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). Crucially, the report squarely indicted Goa&#39;s political leadership: the then Chief Minister (Digambar Kamat, who had also been the mining minister for a decade) was named for permitting the <strong>&quot;plunder&quot;</strong> of Goa&#39;s natural resources (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>).</p>
<p>The Shah Commission&#39;s revelations confirmed what many in Goa had suspected - that a nexus of miners, politicians, and officials had led to a <strong>&quot;rape of the forests&quot;</strong> and large-scale theft of public wealth under the guise of the mining boom. Public outrage in Goa was immediate. Within days, the state government (led by a new Chief Minister, Manohar Parrikar) announced a suspension of all mining in Goa on <strong>September 10, 2012</strong> (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>) (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). The central Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests likewise withdrew environmental clearances for mines, effectively halting any legal mining activity. Subsequently, on <strong>October 5, 2012</strong>, the Supreme Court of India stepped in by issuing an order restraining all mining and transportation of iron ore in Goa until further notice (<a href="https://goafoundation.org/mining/">The State of Mining in Goa | Goa Foundation : Goa Foundation</a>). This was an interim measure as the Supreme Court admitted a PIL (Writ Petition No. 435/2012) filed by the environmental NGO <strong>Goa Foundation</strong> based on the Shah Commission&#39;s findings (<a href="https://goafoundation.org/mining/">The State of Mining in Goa | Goa Foundation : Goa Foundation</a>) (<a href="https://goafoundation.org/mining/">The State of Mining in Goa | Goa Foundation : Goa Foundation</a>).</p>
<p>For the first time in Goa&#39;s history, iron ore mining came to a <strong>complete standstill</strong>. The suspension (often referred to as the &quot;mining ban&quot;) brought instant relief to the environment - rivers ran reddish-brown with silt no more - but it also caused economic pain in Goa. The mining industry, which had become a mainstay for jobs and incomes in the interior, was now under intense judicial scrutiny. The Shah Commission had recommended strict action: prosecution of offenders, recovery of the losses, and environmental restoration, even urging that all mining be stopped within 10 km of wildlife sanctuaries (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/goa-mining-scam-worth-rs-34-935-crore-justice-shah-commission/story-EbEV7zhxNhuQQwwICmQ7dN.html">Goa mining scam worth Rs 34,935 crore: Justice Shah Commission | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). As Goa awaited the final verdict from the Supreme Court, it was clear that the unbridled party of the China boom was over, and a new paradigm of accountability was about to begin.</p>
<h2 id="the-2014-supreme-court-judgment-goa-foundation-case">The 2014 Supreme Court Judgment (Goa Foundation Case)</h2>
<p>After months of hearings, the Supreme Court delivered its landmark judgment in the Goa mining case on <strong>21 April 2014</strong>. This judgment - often referred to as <em>Goa Foundation I</em> - fundamentally reshaped the industry. The Court&#39;s verdict validated many of the Shah Commission&#39;s conclusions and introduced sweeping changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>All mining after 22 November 2007 was declared illegal:</strong> The Court found that all iron ore mining leases in Goa had expired on 22 November 2007 (twenty years after the 1987 abolition of concessions) (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). No valid renewals had been granted by that date. Therefore, any mining activity carried out from November 2007 until the 2012 ban lacked a legal lease and was <strong>ex post facto</strong> deemed illegal (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). This meant every tonne of ore extracted in that period was technically without authority, opening the door for the state to recover the value of that ore from the companies. The ruling, in essence, wiped the slate clean - <strong>all existing mining leases were nullified</strong> for having expired, and the Court said the state could grant new leases henceforth (under appropriate law) rather than &quot;renew&quot; the old ones.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cap on future extraction:</strong> Concerned about environmental sustainability, the Supreme Court imposed an <strong>interim cap of 20 million tonnes per annum (mtpa)</strong> on iron ore that could be mined in Goa (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). This was roughly half of the peak output during the boom. The Court appointed an Expert Committee to conduct a detailed study within 12 months and recommend a scientific annual cap for sustainable mining in Goa (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). Until then, 20 mtpa would be the upper limit. This was a clear message that &quot;business as usual&quot; would not continue.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Handling of mining dumps:</strong> The judgment noted the presence of large waste dumps (piles of low-grade ore and soil) across Goa&#39;s mining belt. An estimated <strong>700 million tonnes</strong> of mining rejects were piled in and around lease areas. The Court directed the Expert Committee to also examine and recommend how to deal with these <strong>iron ore dumps</strong> within 6 months (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). Options included rehabilitating or removing dumps that posed environmental risks, and even <strong>auctioning off dumps</strong> that had usable ore content (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). In some cases, dumps on public land (outside lease boundaries, often in forest areas) could be confiscated and the material sold for the state&#39;s benefit under strict supervision (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>).</p>

<li><p><strong>E-auction of extracted ore:</strong> To prevent mined ore from being siphoned off or sold illicitly during the ban, the Supreme Court set up a <strong>Monitoring Committee</strong> to oversee <strong>e-auctions of all the iron ore already mined and lying in stockpiles</strong> (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). Roughly 15 million tonnes of ore were in stock at pits, jetties, and transit when mining was halted. The Court ordered that this inventory be sold via public e-auctions under the committee&#39;s supervision, with the proceeds to be deposited with the state (minus a portion payable to leaseholders to cover basic costs) (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>) (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). By early 2015, these e-auctions were underway, generating revenue and clearing the accumulated ore. This process brought transparency into the disposition of the ore and prevented any illegal sale while mines remained closed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund:</strong> In a first-of-its-kind move in India, the Supreme Court directed the creation of a <strong>&quot;Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund&quot;</strong> as a means of safeguarding part of the mineral wealth for future generations (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). The concept was rooted in the principle of intergenerational equity - that the finite iron ore wealth of Goa should benefit not just the present stakeholders but also the people of the future. The Court ordered that from now on, <strong>10% of the sale value of all iron ore extracted in Goa would be deposited into this Permanent Fund</strong> (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). This applied to ore sold from the e-auctions and any future mining. The Goa government was given six months to frame a scheme for the Fund in consultation with the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). Such a fund, the Court noted, would operate similar to a sovereign wealth fund - like those in Alaska or Norway - investing the proceeds for the long-term benefit of Goans. This was a pioneering judicial step to ensure <strong>sustainable development</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the <strong>April 2014 judgment was a watershed</strong>. It not only cracked down on past illegality by &quot;resetting&quot; the industry to zero (cancelling leases and deeming past extraction illegal), but also laid down new guidelines for any revival of mining with far greater oversight. The immediate impact was that <strong>mining remained suspended</strong> even after the judgment - until the state could organize a proper system to resume operations within the Court&#39;s framework. The judgment also implied that the Goa government should start afresh in granting mining leases, ideally via a competitive process as per new laws, rather than automatically return to the old leaseholders (<a href="https://m.thewire.in/article/law/supreme-court-dismisses-vedantas-plea-to-renew-mining-lease-in-goa">Supreme Court Dismisses Vedanta&#39;s Plea to Renew Mining Lease in Goa</a>) (<a href="https://m.thewire.in/article/law/supreme-court-dismisses-vedantas-plea-to-renew-mining-lease-in-goa">Supreme Court Dismisses Vedanta&#39;s Plea to Renew Mining Lease in Goa</a>).</p>
<p>Another consequence was the question of <strong>liability and recovery</strong>. By declaring 5 years&#39; worth of mining illegal, the Court opened the door for authorities to demand that mining companies <strong>pay back the profits</strong> from that illegality. The Goa Foundation quickly calculated that the <strong>legally recoverable amount</strong> from mining companies for the ore extracted post-2007 could be as high as Rs 65,000 crore (approximately USD 8-9 billion) (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). If penalties and interest were added, this figure might exceed Rs 100,000 crore (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). These eye-popping numbers, equivalent to nearly a decade of Goa&#39;s state budget, underscored the scale of the alleged mining fraud. The Court&#39;s judgment hinted that the state should take necessary steps under the mining laws (specifically, Section 21(5) of the Mines and Minerals Act) to recover dues from illegal mining (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). However, translating that into actual recovery would prove challenging and is a saga of its own.</p>
<p>For the moment, as of mid-2014, Goa&#39;s iron ore industry was at a standstill - but there was a path laid out for its revival under stricter conditions. The <strong>&quot;clean slate&quot;</strong> created by the Supreme Court was an opportunity to reform how mining was done in the state. Whether that opportunity was seized or squandered is revealed in the subsequent developments.</p>
<h2 id="resumption-and-second-shutdown-2015-2018">Resumption and Second Shutdown (2015-2018)</h2>
<p>After the 2014 Supreme Court judgment, responsibility shifted to the Goa government to chart a path forward. Mining could theoretically resume, but only under new legally valid leases and with environmental clearances, all within the 20 MT annual cap. At this juncture, the Goa government faced a choice: <strong>auction the mining leases to new bidders</strong> (as the spirit of the Supreme Court&#39;s orders - and a forthcoming central law - seemed to suggest), or <strong>&quot;renew&quot; the leases of the old leaseholders</strong> (the same companies and families who had operated in the past). In 2014, the Indian Parliament was also amending the national mining law to mandate auctions for allotting mineral resources in the future. The state government, however, was eager to restart mining quickly to revive the economy, and it leaned toward reinstating the previous leaseholders.</p>
<p>By late 2014, the Goa government (led by the Bharatiya Janata Party under Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar) began processing &quot;second renewal&quot; applications of those 88 mining leases that had existed pre-ban. In a <strong>hurried spree between November 2014 and January 2015</strong>, lease after lease was renewed in favor of the same companies that held them earlier. The haste was extraordinary - <strong>56 leases were renewed within a week (Jan 5 to Jan 12, 2015)</strong>, with <strong>31 leases renewed on a single day: 12 January 2015</strong> (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>) (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). Not coincidentally, January 12, 2015 was the date when an Ordinance (and later an amendment to the Mines and Minerals Act) came into effect, requiring all new mining licenses to be granted via competitive auctions rather than direct renewals (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). By pushing through the renewals just before this deadline, the Goa government effectively <strong>bypassed the new auction mandate</strong>. The state&#39;s motivation, it claimed, was to enable mining to restart as fast as possible to alleviate the economic suffering from the ban (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). Critics, however, saw it as a blatant attempt to favor incumbent mining companies - a decision <strong>&quot;done in great hurry&quot;</strong> that sacrificed the public interest (potential auction revenue) to benefit a few private players (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>) (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>).</p>
<p>With the renewals in hand (each lease ostensibly extended till 2037, i.e., 50 years from 1987, though this interpretation was contested), mining companies moved to restart operations. By late <strong>2015 and early 2016</strong>, iron ore extraction in Goa gradually resumed on a small scale (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). The output was nowhere near pre-ban levels, partly due to the Supreme Court&#39;s 20 MT cap and prevailing low global ore prices at that time. Still, the resumption brought relief to mining-dependent villages - trucks rolled out, and barges started moving ore down the rivers once again. The years <strong>2015-2017</strong> saw a cautious comeback of the industry, operating under new monitoring mechanisms and with the looming possibility that the Supreme Court might review the lease renewal decision.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Goa Foundation and other activists swiftly challenged the lease renewals. In September 2015, the Goa Foundation filed another petition (often called <em>Goa Foundation II</em>) in the Supreme Court, arguing that the renewal of 88 leases without auction was illegal and against the principles laid down in the 2014 judgment (<a href="https://goafoundation.org/mining/">The State of Mining in Goa - Goa Foundation</a>). They contended that the state should have treated the post-2007 period as a fresh start and conducted auctions to maximize public revenue (as eventually required by the amended law), rather than gifting 20-year extensions to the same operators accused of past misconduct. The case was taken up by the Supreme Court, and hearings took place through 2017.</p>
<p>On <strong>7 February 2018</strong>, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment on the renewal issue - a harsh rebuke to the Goa government. The Court <strong>quashed all 88 mining lease renewals granted in 2014-15</strong>, terming them <strong>&quot;unduly hasty&quot;</strong>, arbitrary, and <strong>in violation of law</strong> (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>) (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/sc-rejects-goa-govt-vedanta-pleas-to-review-judgement-cancelling-mining-leases-101626770434232.html">SC rejects Goa govt, Vedanta pleas to review judgement cancelling mining leases - Hindustan Times</a>). It agreed with the petitioners that the state&#39;s decision was influenced by pressure to resume mining and possibly by extraneous considerations, rather than a careful application of the law (<a href="https://m.thewire.in/article/law/supreme-court-dismisses-vedantas-plea-to-renew-mining-lease-in-goa">Supreme Court Dismisses Vedanta&#39;s Plea to Renew Mining Lease in Goa</a>) (<a href="https://m.thewire.in/article/law/supreme-court-dismisses-vedantas-plea-to-renew-mining-lease-in-goa">Supreme Court Dismisses Vedanta&#39;s Plea to Renew Mining Lease in Goa</a>). The Bench noted that many renewals were pushed through just as the auction mandate was kicking in, which <strong>&quot;only an ostrich with its head buried in sand&quot;</strong> could interpret as routine rather than mala fide haste (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). In essence, the Supreme Court&#39;s 2018 ruling (Goa Foundation II) reiterated that no mining could take place on these leases until they were granted afresh in accordance with law. The Court allowed mining activity by the erstwhile leaseholders to continue only until <strong>15 March 2018</strong> to wind up operations, after which <strong>all mining in Goa was ordered to stop again from 16 March 2018</strong> (<a href="https://m.thewire.in/article/law/supreme-court-dismisses-vedantas-plea-to-renew-mining-lease-in-goa">Supreme Court Dismisses Vedanta&#39;s Plea to Renew Mining Lease in Goa</a>). This marked the <strong>second complete shutdown</strong> of Goa&#39;s mining industry in a decade.</p>
<p>The 2015-2018 interlude thus ended abruptly. While it lasted, the mining companies exported a few million tonnes of ore (mostly clearing old stock and low-grade material) and the state earned some revenue, but the Supreme Court&#39;s crackdown meant that long-term continuity was not achieved. Goa was back to square one: after March 2018, iron ore mining was once again at a standstill, awaiting a lawful path to restart. This episode of renewal-and-quashing also underscored the governance issues in Goa&#39;s mining sector - the <strong>&quot;second renewal&quot;</strong> fiasco would soon come under scrutiny as a case of possible corruption and maladministration.</p>
<h2 id="fallout-of-lease-quashing-lokayukta-inquiry-and-accountability">Fallout of Lease Quashing: Lokayukta Inquiry and Accountability</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court&#39;s 2018 judgment not only halted mining but also cast doubt on the integrity of the decision-makers who had rushed through the lease renewals. Sensing wrongdoing, the Goa Foundation took the battle to the state&#39;s anti-corruption ombudsman, the <strong>Goa Lokayukta</strong>. In 2018, Goa Foundation&#39;s director, Dr. Claude Alvares, filed a formal complaint alleging that the manner in which the 88 leases were renewed was an <strong>&quot;act of corruption&quot;</strong> involving a conspiracy by public officials to unduly favor mining companies (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others - Hindustan Times</a>) (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). The complaint named former Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar (in office during the renewals), along with the then Secretary for Mines and the Director of Mines, as responsible for decisions that caused a huge loss to the state exchequer by not auctioning the leases (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/file-fir-against-ex-cm-top-officials-lokayukta-to-govt/articleshow/73501135.cms">File FIR against Laxmikant Parsekar, bureaucrats for mining renewals</a>) (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>).</p>
<p>After investigating the complaint, the Lokayukta, Justice P.K. Misra, delivered a scathing report in 2019. He concluded that the second renewal of the mining leases in Goa appeared to be the <strong>result of corrupt practices</strong> and an abuse of power (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/second-renewal-was-to-satisfy-greed-of-lease-holders-lokayukta/articleshow/73501710.cms">Second renewal was to satisfy greed of lease holders: Lokayukta</a>). The Lokayukta pointed out the inexplicable urgency shown in January 2015: &quot;overnight renewals effected at a speed faster than that of the fastest jaguar or cheetah&quot; - a metaphor he used to underscore how unusually fast and non-transparent the process was (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). By renewing 56 leases in the span of 7 days, officials had clearly attempted to <strong>avoid the auction route</strong> mandated by the new Ordinance, an act that Justice Misra found highly suspicious (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). In his report, the Lokayukta stated that the three respondents (Parsekar and the two officials) <strong>&quot;abused their official position, thereby causing loss to the entire State of Goa and benefitting only a few mining lease holders.&quot;</strong> (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). This was a direct indictment of the renewal decision as one driven by vested interests rather than public interest.</p>
<p>The Lokayukta recommended firm action: he directed that an <strong>FIR (First Information Report)</strong> be filed to initiate a criminal investigation under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and further urged the case be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for an independent probe (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). He also advised that the two senior bureaucrats involved be relieved of any official duties pending inquiry (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). This was a strong stance, effectively calling for potential prosecution of a former Chief Minister - a rare event in Goa&#39;s political history.</p>
<p>In response, Laxmikant Parsekar denied any personal gain from the renewals, claiming it was a collective cabinet decision aimed at restarting mining to help the state&#39;s economy, and that &quot;not a single rupee&quot; was taken by him (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). He argued that the matter was effectively settled by the Supreme Court cancelling the leases, implying no further action was necessary (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-lokayukta-indicts-former-cm-2-others/story-5yI0mIvayRbvbFJDvIGzVO.html">Goa Lokayukta indicts former CM, 2 others | Latest News India - Hindustan Times</a>). As of the time of this report, however, the Goa government (led by the same party that Parsekar belonged to) has been ambivalent in acting on the Lokayukta&#39;s recommendations. While the Lokayukta&#39;s findings added moral weight to the critique of the renewal process, translating them into legal action has proven difficult - no CBI investigation or high-profile prosecution has been reported yet. The episode did reinforce the narrative of a <strong>&quot;Great Goan Mining Heist&quot;</strong>, wherein a handful of mining barons and complicit officials enriched themselves at the cost of the public treasury and environment (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>).</p>
<p>In parallel, other efforts at accountability were underway. A <strong>Special Investigation Team (SIT)</strong> of the Goa Police had been set up back in 2013 (after the Shah Commission report) to investigate dozens of cases of illegal mining and file criminal charges. Over the years, the SIT filed multiple charge sheets against mining companies and individuals for illegal extraction, fraudulent permits, etc. However, progress was painfully slow. By 2022, it was reported that the SIT had achieved little in terms of convictions - indeed, after nearly a decade, the mining scam investigations had &quot;nothing to show,&quot; with most cases still mired in procedural delays or quietly closed (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ten-years-later-sit-probing-35k-cr-mining-scam-has-nothing-to-show/articleshow/113404295.cms">Ten years later, SIT probing 35k cr mining scam has nothing to show | Goa News - The Times of India</a>) (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ten-years-later-sit-probing-35k-cr-mining-scam-has-nothing-to-show/articleshow/113404295.cms">Ten years later, SIT probing 35k cr mining scam has nothing to show | Goa News - The Times of India</a>).

This underscored the challenges in pursuing criminal accountability for the complex, decade-spanning mining scam, especially once the immediate public pressure subsided.</p>
<h2 id="further-litigation-and-policy-debates-2018-2022">Further Litigation and Policy Debates (2018-2022)</h2>
<p>With mining idled again after March 2018, the focus shifted to how (and if) the industry could be revived in a legally compliant way. From 2018 through 2021, there was a flurry of litigation and policy discussions on this matter:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Review Petitions in Supreme Court:</strong> The Goa state government and Vedanta (one of Goa&#39;s largest mining leaseholders) both filed review petitions against the Supreme Court&#39;s February 2018 decision. These petitions essentially asked the Court to reconsider or clarify the judgment, especially regarding the handling of the 88 leases. However, both petitions were filed extremely late - Vedanta&#39;s over 900 days later, and the Goa government&#39;s after about 650 days - well beyond the 30-day limit for review applications (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/sc-rejects-goa-govt-vedanta-pleas-to-review-judgement-cancelling-mining-leases-101626770434232.html">SC rejects Goa govt, Vedanta pleas to review judgement cancelling mining leases - Hindustan Times</a>) (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/sc-rejects-goa-govt-vedanta-pleas-to-review-judgement-cancelling-mining-leases-101626770434232.html">SC rejects Goa govt, Vedanta pleas to review judgement cancelling mining leases - Hindustan Times</a>). The Supreme Court was notably displeased with this delay, suspecting it as a tactic: it pointed out that the filings happened only after the original judges had retired, calling the timing unacceptable (<a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/sc-rejects-goa-govt-vedanta-pleas-to-review-judgement-cancelling-mining-leases-101626770434232.html">SC rejects Goa govt, Vedanta pleas to review judgement cancelling mining leases - Hindustan Times</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Vedanta&#39;s &quot;50-year lease&quot; Argument:</strong> Separately from the review petition, Vedanta pursued a legal argument based on a 2015 amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development &amp; Regulation) Act (MMDR Act). The amendment (Section 8A) provided that mineral leases would be valid for 50 years. Vedanta asserted that because of this change, its Goa mining lease - originally granted in 1987 after the abolition of concessions - should be considered valid until <strong>2037</strong> (50 years from 1987) by operation of law (<a href="https://m.thewire.in/article/law/supreme-court-dismisses-vedantas-plea-to-renew-mining-lease-in-goa">Supreme Court Dismisses Vedanta&#39;s Plea to Renew Mining Lease in Goa</a>) (<a href="https://m.thewire.in/article/law/supreme-court-dismisses-vedantas-plea-to-renew-mining-lease-in-goa">Supreme Court Dismisses Vedanta&#39;s Plea to Renew Mining Lease in Goa</a>). Essentially, they claimed the Supreme Court&#39;s cancellation didn&#39;t account for the retrospective extension granted by Section 8A. The Goa government showed sympathy to this theory but said it was powerless due to the Court rulings (<a href="https://m.thewire.in/article/law/supreme-court-dismisses-vedantas-plea-to-renew-mining-lease-in-goa">Supreme Court Dismisses Vedanta&#39;s Plea to Renew Mining Lease in Goa</a>) (<a href="https://m.thewire.in/article/law/supreme-court-dismisses-vedantas-plea-to-renew-mining-lease-in-goa">Supreme Court Dismisses Vedanta&#39;s Plea to Renew Mining Lease in Goa</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Legislative and Executive Efforts:</strong> During these years, the Goa government and central government explored legislative fixes to restart mining. There were discussions about a possible Ordinance or special exemption for Goa, given the economic distress of mining dependents (around 300,000 people were said to be affected by the halt). The central government did introduce changes in the MMDR Act in 2021 (for instance, removing the distinction between captive and non-captive mines and simplifying clearance transfers), but it stopped short of carving out an exception to allow Goa&#39;s old leaseholders to resume without auction. Essentially, the political leadership eventually reconciled to the fact that auctions were inevitable.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Impact and Interim Relief:</strong> The mining ban&#39;s economic impact on Goa was significant. State revenues from mining royalties dropped by over 79% in the ban years (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>) (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). Debt levels rose as the government lost a major source of income (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). Allied businesses - trucking, barging, equipment - suffered losses estimated in hundreds of crores of rupees (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). Unemployment climbed in mining areas, with estimates of over 10,000 job losses directly in mining and more in related sectors (<a href="https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf">https://cuts-ccier.org/pdf/policy-brief-goa-mining-case.pdf</a>). These figures were frequently cited in political forums, keeping pressure on the government to find a solution. The state provided some <em>ad hoc</em> assistance (like financial aid to truck owners and mining workers) and lobbied New Delhi for help. But for the most part, the mining regions had to endure a prolonged slump, with many people shifting to other occupations or migrating.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, between 2018 and 2022, every attempt by the former leaseholders or the state to resume mining was either blocked by the courts or found unviable. By 2022, it had become clear that the only path to restarting Goa&#39;s mines would be through the process now enshrined in law: <strong>competitive bidding (auctions) for new mining leases</strong>. This marked a turning point - from protracted courtroom battles to a more transparent (if unfamiliar) method of allocating Goa&#39;s mineral resources.</p>
<h2 id="auctions-and-the-road-ahead-2022-onwards">Auctions and the Road Ahead (2022-Onwards)</h2>
<p>Having exhausted legal challenges, Goa finally embraced the auction route to restart its mining industry. In 2022, the state government, with assistance from central agencies, prepared to auction the iron ore blocks to new operators. This process involved delineating mining blocks (sometimes merging or reconfiguring the old Portuguese-era concession areas for viability), obtaining necessary clearances, and setting up e-auction procedures.</p>
<p>The <strong>first phase of mineral lease auctions</strong> was launched in the second half of <strong>2022</strong>. By December 2022, four iron ore blocks had been successfully auctioned to the highest bidders (<a href="https://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/goa-government-completes-first-phase-of-auction-of-iron-ore-mining-blocks/articleshow/96421040.cms">goa: Goa government completes first phase of auction of iron ore mining blocks - The Economic Times</a>) (<a href="https://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/goa-government-completes-first-phase-of-auction-of-iron-ore-mining-blocks/articleshow/96421040.cms">goa: Goa government completes first phase of auction of iron ore mining blocks - The Economic Times</a>). These four blocks roughly corresponded to ten of the former concession areas, combined into larger blocks for efficiency (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-recent-mineral-block-auctions-in-goa/">The recent mineral block auctions in Goa</a>). Notably, the auction saw a mix of Goa&#39;s traditional mining players and outside firms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vedanta Ltd</strong>, a major national mining firm (and former leaseholder in Goa), won the <strong>Bicholim-Mulgao block</strong> in North Goa, which holds over 84 million tonnes of iron ore reserves (<a href="https://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/goa-government-completes-first-phase-of-auction-of-iron-ore-mining-blocks/articleshow/96421040.cms">goa: Goa government completes first phase of auction of iron ore mining blocks - The Economic Times</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Salgaocar Shipping Co. Pvt Ltd</strong>, part of a prominent Goan business family that had been in mining logistics, won the <strong>Sirigao-Mayem block</strong> in North Goa, with about 24 million tonnes of reserves (<a href="https://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/goa-government-completes-first-phase-of-auction-of-iron-ore-mining-blocks/articleshow/96421040.cms">goa: Goa government completes first phase of auction of iron ore mining blocks - The Economic Times</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Rajaram Bandekar Pvt Ltd (R.B. Mines)</strong>, a local Goan mining company, won the <strong>Monte de Sirigao block</strong> (also in North Goa) containing around 10 million tonnes (<a href="https://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/goa-government-completes-first-phase-of-auction-of-iron-ore-mining-blocks/articleshow/96421040.cms">goa: Goa government completes first phase of auction of iron ore mining blocks - The Economic Times</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Sociedade de Fomento Industries Pvt Ltd (Fomento)</strong>, another longstanding Goan mining group, secured the <strong>Kalay block</strong> in South Goa, with approximately 16.7 million tonnes of reserves (<a href="https://m.economictimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/metals-mining/goa-government-completes-first-phase-of-auction-of-iron-ore-mining-blocks/articleshow/96421040.cms">goa: Goa government completes first phase of auction of iron ore mining blocks - The Economic Times</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The auction results indicated that some of Goa&#39;s traditional mining players (Salgaocar, Fomento, Bandekar) would continue to be involved, while others like Vedanta would also play a big role. The government declared this first phase a success and quickly moved to plan further auctions. By mid-2023, a second phase of auctioning additional blocks (five more blocks were tendered in early 2023) was underway (<a href="https://www.blackridgeresearch.com/blog/goa-coal-mine-auction-second-round">Goa Invites Tenders for Mining Leases for Five Iron Ores in the...</a>) (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>).</p>
<p>The auction process was significant for a few reasons. First, it promised to <strong>maximize revenue for the state</strong> - under the auction terms, winners have to pay an upfront premium (a percentage of the ore&#39;s value) to the government for every tonne mined, in addition to royalties and other taxes. Early indications were that the bids were competitive, ensuring Goa would get a better share of the mining proceeds than it historically did. In the December 2022 auctions, the state received an upfront payment of about Rs 43 crore from the winners and stands to gain substantially once mining resumes (<a href="https://www.heraldgoa.in/Goa/Iron-ore-mining-activity-may-resume-in-202324-says-CM/205529">Iron ore mining activity may resume in 2023-24, says CM - Herald Goa</a>). Second, auctions aimed to <strong>introduce transparency and competition</strong> in a sector previously plagued by favoritism. Every bidder had to meet environmental and technical criteria, which could incentivize more responsible actors. Third, with new leases in place, the <strong>way was clear to restart mining legally</strong>, ending years of uncertainty. The Chief Minister announced that he expected actual mining operations to restart by early 2024 under the new leaseholders, after they obtain the required environmental clearances and licenses (<a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2022/Oct/01/goa-mining-leases-auction-to-get-over-by-nov-2022-fresh-extraction-to-startyear-later-cm-sawant-2503930.html">Goa mining leases auction to get over by Nov 2022, fresh extraction...</a>).</p>
<p>While the auctions mark a fresh chapter, there remain challenges and lessons from the past to heed. Environmental oversight will be crucial - Goa&#39;s regulatory institutions will need to ensure strict compliance with mining plans, dump management, and the 20 MT annual cap (or whatever sustainable limit is decided). The Supreme Court&#39;s directives like the Permanent Fund are still in effect, meaning 10% of the mining proceeds will continue to be saved for the future (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). Additionally, the state has large legacy issues to manage: rehabilitation of abandoned mines, reforesting depleted areas, and dealing with existing mine waste dumps. In 2023, Goa formulated a new policy for handling the old dumps, aiming to auction some of them for recovery of ore while rehabilitating the sites (<a href="https://goenchimati.org/the-great-goan-mining-heist-implications-of-the-2014-supreme-court-judgement-ruling/">The Great Goan Mining Heist: Implications of the 2014 Supreme Court Judgement Ruling - The Goenchi Mati Movement</a>). There is also the unresolved issue of whether Goa will pursue the massive recoveries (Rs 65,000+ crore) from past illegal mining - a political hot potato that so far has seen little action.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the story of iron ore mining in Goa is a <strong>cautionary tale of boom and bust</strong>. From the early 20th century when the first concessions were granted, through the Portuguese boom, to the post-colonial integration and the wild China-driven surge, mining brought both prosperity and peril to Goa. The legal interventions since 2012 - from the Shah Commission to consecutive Supreme Court judgments - were a response to the excesses and a clarion call for sustainable governance of natural resources. As of 2025, Goa stands at the threshold of restarting its mining industry under a new paradigm of auctions and stricter oversight. If the mistakes of the past are addressed, Goa&#39;s mining can perhaps become a model of balanced resource management, contributing to the economy while preserving the environment and the interests of future generations (<a href="https://goafoundation.org/mining/">The State of Mining in Goa | Goa Foundation : Goa Foundation</a>) (<a href="https://goafoundation.org/mining/">The State of Mining in Goa | Goa Foundation : Goa Foundation</a>). The narrative of Goa&#39;s mining will continue to evolve, but its recent history will remain a powerful reminder that natural wealth, if not managed transparently and responsibly, can quickly turn from a blessing into a curse.</p>
