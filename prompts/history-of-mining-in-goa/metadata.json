  "sceneDescription": "A weathered scale dominates a cramped courtyard, piled high with legal documents on one side and lumps of iron ore on the other. Colonial pillars in the background evoke the Portuguese era, while modern officials in neat suits stand nearby, peering over the documents. A judge’s gavel, half-buried in a mound of iron ore dust, discreetly references past litigations. Off to one side, a small signboard with a hammer symbol hints at new auctions. The tense balance captures Goa’s tangled legacy of mining, law, and shifting fortunes.",
