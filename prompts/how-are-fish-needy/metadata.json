    "\"A healthy fish usually has vibrant colors. If a fish’s colors become pale, washed-out, or darkened suddenly, it can indicate stress or sickness.\"",
    "\"Changes in how a fish acts are often the first indication that something is wrong in the aquarium.\"",
    "\"Gasping is a serious distress signal – the fish is essentially suffocating.\"",
    "\"If you see changes like discoloration, spots, clamped fins, or swelling, those are the fish’s way of showing distress.\"",
    "\"You’ll not only react to problems but also anticipate your fishes’ needs, providing them a healthy environment where they rarely have to show distress.\""

  "sceneDescription": "A single aquarium sits on a simple table in a spare living room. A concerned caretaker leans in close, pressing a stethoscope gently to the glass. Inside, a modest goldfish appears wide-eyed and expectant, subtly angled as if signaling something urgent. In the corner of the room, a wilted houseplant droops, hinting at its own silent pleas. Soft lines and minimal detailing emphasize the quiet tension between watcher and watched.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "2. This illustration effectively captures the article's theme, with the concerned caretaker and wide-eyed goldfish suggesting communication. The wilted plant adds depth to the narrative, connecting the idea of plants’ visible signals. The style aligns well with The New Yorker's iconic cartoons, using minimal detail to emphasize the quiet tension."
