  "pullQuotes": [
    "\"Long-run white-collar labor cost deflation presents a double-edged sword: it can boost profits and enable new pricing strategies, but it also poses risks.\"",
    "\"Decision-makers should evaluate ROI on tech investments not just against current labor costs, but against the future trajectory.\"",
    "\"Many white-collar tasks are being automated by relatively affordable software – a capital (or sometimes cloud subscription) investment.\"",
    "\"Companies might increase their use of contractors and gig workers for peak workload periods instead of maintaining excess staff.\"",
    "\"A middle-of-the-road strategy is dangerous when everyone’s costs are falling, because customers either gravitate to the cheapest adequate option or to the unique high-value option.\""

  "sceneDescription": "A row of identical office cubicles stretches under harsh fluorescent lights. Several white-collar employees slump at their desks, each overshadowed by a vast, looming outline of robotic arms hovering behind them. To the side, a manager in a well-tailored suit studies a giant spreadsheet with a downward-sloping arrow. A few discarded reports litter the floor, as if tossed aside. The scene is tense yet understated, suggesting wage pressures quietly bearing down on these professionals.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "2. This illustration effectively captures the essence of economic pressure and automation's impact on white-collar workers. The looming robotic arms create a strong visual metaphor for encroaching technology, and the slumped employees add to the tone of deflation and stress. The downward-sloping arrow in the spreadsheet reinforces the theme of declining wages. The composition is clear and characteristic of New Yorker cartoon style, balancing subtle humor with a sophisticated critique."
