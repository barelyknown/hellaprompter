# Professional Backgrounds of U.S. Major-Party Presidential Candidates (Lawyers vs. Non-Lawyers)

## Overview of Lawyer vs. Non-Lawyer Candidates  
Historically, a **majority of U.S. major-party presidential nominees** have come from the legal profession. In fact, over half of all U.S. presidents (26 out of 45) were trained as lawyers ([The Long History of America’s Lawyer Presidents | Blog | Lawline](https://blog.lawline.com/the-long-history-of-americas-lawyer-presidents#:~:text=Many%20U,presidents)), and roughly 60% of major-party nominees in history had legal backgrounds (either as attorneys or judges). By contrast, a significant minority have come from **non-legal backgrounds** – including military generals, businessmen, and others. Out of **63 individuals** who have been Democratic or Republican presidential nominees through 2020, **36 were lawyers** by profession (57%) and 27 were not. When counting each nomination (including candidates who ran multiple times), about **61% of all major-party candidacies** were led by lawyers. 

- **Early dominance of lawyers:** In the early 19th century, virtually *all* major American politicians were lawyers. For example, founding-era presidents like Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe studied and practiced law before entering politics, as did Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk in the Jacksonian era ([The Long History of America’s Lawyer Presidents | Blog | Lawline](https://blog.lawline.com/the-long-history-of-americas-lawyer-presidents#:~:text=Many%20U,presidents)) ([Which U.S. Presidents Were Lawyers? - Civille](https://getciville.com/which-u-s-presidents-were-lawyers/#:~:text=Which%20U,John%20Tyler%20%C2%B7%20James)). This trend carried into the formation of the Democratic Party in the 1830s – *every* Democratic nominee from 1828 through 1852 had a legal background (Jackson, Van Buren, Polk, Lewis Cass, Franklin Pierce, etc.). 

- **Changing mix over time:** As the country evolved, *non-lawyer* candidates began to appear. Military heroes became political contenders (e.g. **Gen. Winfield Scott** and **Gen. Ulysses S. Grant**), and by the late 19th and early 20th centuries a few businessmen and career politicians without law degrees also made bids. Still, through the **19th century** and into the early **20th century**, lawyers remained dominant among nominees of both major parties. **27 U.S. presidents had worked as lawyers** (and 9 had been career generals) by the mid-20th century ([List of presidents of the United States by previous experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_previous_experience#:~:text=List%20of%20presidents%20of%20the,presidents%20previously%20served%20as)), reflecting how common a legal career was for national leaders.

The table below summarizes the overall success rates of lawyer vs. non-lawyer candidates:

| **1828–2020 Major-Party Nominees** | **Lawyers** | **Non-Lawyers** |
|------------------------------------|------------:|---------------:|
| Total Nominations                  | 56          | 35             |
| Won Presidency (elections won)     | 30          | 17             |
| Success Rate (win percentage)      | ~54%        | ~49%           |

*Table:* **Election outcomes for lawyer vs. non-lawyer candidates.** (Each nomination counted; some individuals ran more than once.) Overall, candidates with legal backgrounds have won **about half** of their races (~54%), versus ~49% for those without legal training. In other words, *lawyers have been only slightly more likely to win* the presidency than non-lawyers over the long run. The small difference suggests that while many nominees have been lawyers, having a law degree **has not guaranteed victory** – and several non-lawyers have been quite successful (for example, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and businessman Donald Trump both won the presidency without any formal legal background ([Dwight D. Eisenhower | Biography, Cold War, Presidency, & Facts](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dwight-D-Eisenhower#:~:text=Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower%20,Europe%20during%20World%20War%20II)) ([History of Donald Trump | Humans - Vocal Media](https://vocal.media/humans/history-of-donald-trump#:~:text=History%20of%20Donald%20Trump%20,States%20from%202017%20to%202021))).

## Trends by Decade and Party Affiliation  
The proportion of lawyer-candidates has **shifted markedly over time**, with some distinct eras. The visualization below shows the percentage of major-party nominees each decade who were lawyers, broken down by party:

 ([image]()) *Percentage of Democratic (yellow) and Republican (orange) presidential nominees who were lawyers, by decade. In the early 1800s, Democratic nominees were uniformly lawyers (100%), while the Republican Party did not exist until the 1850s. Values for the 1850s onward reflect each party’s nominee(s) in that decade’s elections.*  

Several patterns stand out:

- **Early 1800s (1820s–1840s):** The Democratic Party’s candidates were **almost all lawyers** by profession. From Andrew Jackson through James Buchanan, Democratic nominees typically had extensive legal careers (e.g. Jackson was a frontier attorney and judge ([The Long History of America’s Lawyer Presidents | Blog | Lawline](https://blog.lawline.com/the-long-history-of-americas-lawyer-presidents#:~:text=Andrew%20Jackson%20%281829)), Martin Van Buren was a state attorney general and lawyer ([List of United States Democratic Party presidential tickets - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Democratic_Party_presidential_tickets#:~:text=Prior%20public%20experience)), and Polk and Pierce likewise practiced law). In this era, legal training was considered essential for statesmen. There was *no Republican Party yet* (its first nominee ran in 1856), but other major candidates of the early 19th century (Federalists, Whigs, etc.) were similarly often lawyers or statesmen; for instance, **Abraham Lincoln** – the first Republican president (1860) – was himself a self-taught lawyer ([The Long History of America’s Lawyer Presidents | Blog | Lawline](https://blog.lawline.com/the-long-history-of-americas-lawyer-presidents#:~:text=Many%20U,presidents)).

- **Mid/Late 19th Century (1850s–1890s):** Both Democrats and the new Republican Party continued to favor lawyer-candidates, though a few notable exceptions appeared. **Republicans** had a mix: e.g. **John C. Frémont** (the GOP’s first nominee in 1856) was *not* a lawyer (he was an explorer and army officer), whereas **Abraham Lincoln (1860)** and most late-1800s Republicans (Hayes, Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, etc.) *were* lawyers. The Democratic Party in this period stuck largely with lawyers as well – from 1856 through 1896, the vast majority of Democratic nominees (Buchanan, Stephen Douglas, Horatio Seymour, Samuel Tilden, Grover Cleveland, William J. Bryan, etc.) had legal backgrounds, with only an occasional non-lawyer (e.g. **Horace Greeley** in 1872 was a newspaper editor). As the chart shows, **both parties in the Gilded Age had 60–100% of their nominees being lawyers per decade**. This reflects the fact that being a lawyer was a common path to political leadership in 19th-century America ([List of presidents of the United States by previous experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_previous_experience#:~:text=List%20of%20presidents%20of%20the,presidents%20previously%20served%20as)).

- **Early 20th Century (1900–1940):** Lawyer-candidates were still common, but we see the start of more **professional diversity**. Democrats from 1900–1930s were mostly lawyers (🔥 *e.g. Alton Parker 1904, Woodrow Wilson* – who trained in law – *1912/16, John W. Davis 1924, Franklin D. Roosevelt 1932* all had legal trainin ([Which US Presidents Were Lawyers? - Legal Language Services](https://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/us-presidents-lawyers/#:~:text=Services%20www,follows%20in%20the%20footsteps))】). However, Democrats did nominate a couple of non-lawyers in this era (e.g. **James Cox (1920)** and **Al Smith (1928)** were career newspapermen/politicians without law degrees). Republicans between 1900 and 1940 alternated between lawyers and non-lawyers. For instance, **Theodore Roosevelt (1904)** and **Herbert Hoover (1928)** had non-legal backgrounds (TR was a career politician and writer; Hoover was a mining engineer), whereas **William H. Taft (1908)** and **Charles Evans Hughes (1916)** were prominent lawyers/jurists. By the 1930s, the GOP had two non-lawyer nominees in a row – Hoover and **Alf Landon (1936)** – making the **1930s the first decade where 0% of Republican nominees were lawyers** (see orange line dropping to zero in the 1930s on the chart). In short, by the early 20th century, **most Democratic nominees still tended to be lawyers**, while **Republicans showed a bit more variety**, occasionally turning to business or military leaders.

- **Post–World War II Era (1950s–1970s):** This period saw **significant shifts** in each party’s profile. Immediately after WWII, *both parties broke the mold:* The **Republicans nominated General Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952**, a career military hero with no prior legal or political office (the first non-lawyer GOP nominee to win in the 20th century ([Dwight D. Eisenhower | Biography, Cold War, Presidency, & Facts](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dwight-D-Eisenhower#:~:text=Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower%20,Europe%20during%20World%20War%20II))】. The **Democrats in 1952 and 1956 ran Adlai Stevenson II**, a former lawyer (and Illinois governor) – but then in the 1960s and 70s, Democrats shifted to a slate of *non-lawyer candidates*. Notably, **John F. Kennedy (1960)** had a background in journalism and politics (but no law degree), **Lyndon B. Johnson (1964)** had been a teacher and career politician, **Hubert Humphrey (1968)** was a pharmacist-turned-politician, and **Jimmy Carter (1976)** was a Naval officer and peanut farmer-turned-politician. **None of those Democratic nominees in the 1960s–70s were lawyers**, as reflected by the Democratic line hitting 0% in the 1960s–70s on the chart. In contrast, **Republicans in the 1960s–70s often nominated lawyers** (both **Richard Nixon** and **Gerald Ford** were lawyers by training). The 1970s particularly stand out: in the **1972 and 1976 elections, 100% of GOP nominees were lawyers** (Nixon and Ford), while 0% of Democratic nominees were (McGovern and Carter). This was a flip from the 19th-century pattern and a **unique moment** where Republicans appeared as the party of lawyer-politicians and Democrats as the party of “outsider” backgrounds.

- **Recent Decades (1980s–2020):** A **near-complete reversal** emerged by the late 20th century. Since the 1980s, **Democrats have overwhelmingly nominated lawyers**, while **Republicans have mostly chosen non-lawyers**. For example, every Democratic nominee from 1984 through 2020 except one (*Al Gore in 2000*) had a law degree or legal career – including **Walter Mondale (1984)**, **Michael Dukakis (1988)**, **Bill Clinton (1992/96)**, **John Kerry (2004)**, **Barack Obama (2008/12)**, **Hillary Clinton (2016)**, and **Joe Biden (2020)**, all of whom are attorney ([Which US Presidents Were Lawyers? - Legal Language Services](https://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/us-presidents-lawyers/#:~:text=Services%20www,follows%20in%20the%20footsteps))】. On the other hand, **Republican nominees since the 1980s have mostly been from outside the legal profession**. The GOP turned to a former actor (**Ronald Reagan, 1980/84**), a CIA director/businessman (**George H.W. Bush, 1988/92**), a business executive (**Mitt Romney, 2012**, who earned a law degree but made his career in business), and a real-estate mogul/TV personality (**Donald Trump, 2016/20**), none of whom were practicing lawyer ([Ronald Reagan: Biography, 40th U.S. President, Politician, Actor](https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan#:~:text=Ronald%20Reagan%3A%20Biography%2C%2040th%20U,Read%20about%20his%20movies%2C)) ([History of Donald Trump | Humans - Vocal Media](https://vocal.media/humans/history-of-donald-trump#:~:text=History%20of%20Donald%20Trump%20,States%20from%202017%20to%202021))】. The only Republican presidential nominee with a prominent legal background in the last 40+ years was **Bob Dole (1996)**, who had been a lawyer early in his career – and he was defeated by lawyer Bill Clinton. Thus, by the 21st century the **Democratic Party has leaned heavily on candidates with legal resumes**, whereas the **Republican Party has favored candidates with military or business credentials**. This divergence is clearly shown in the chart’s final decades: from the 1980s onward the Democratic line is near 100% (almost all nominees lawyers), while the Republican line falls to 0% in the 1980s/2000s (no lawyers, e.g. Reagan, Bush, Trump ([Ronald Reagan: Biography, 40th U.S. President, Politician, Actor](https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan#:~:text=Ronald%20Reagan%3A%20Biography%2C%2040th%20U,Read%20about%20his%20movies%2C)) ([History of Donald Trump | Humans - Vocal Media](https://vocal.media/humans/history-of-donald-trump#:~:text=History%20of%20Donald%20Trump%20,States%20from%202017%20to%202021))】.

**Historical context:** The shift from the **“lawyer-statesman” model (common in the 1800s)** to a more diverse set of backgrounds reflects broader changes in society. In the **early 1800s**, legal expertise was practically a prerequisite for national leadership – lawyers were seen as skilled orators and thinkers in an era of constitutional formation and expansio ([The Long History of America’s Lawyer Presidents | Blog | Lawline](https://blog.lawline.com/the-long-history-of-americas-lawyer-presidents#:~:text=Many%20U,presidents))】. By the **post-WWII era**, other forms of experience gained public esteem – for example, **military leadership (WWII generals)** or **business success** were seen as proving one’s executive abilities. The parties responded to these perceptions: e.g., Republicans won big with war hero Eisenhower in 1952, and later with celebrity-turned-politician Reagan in 198 ([Dwight D. Eisenhower | Biography, Cold War, Presidency, & Facts](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dwight-D-Eisenhower#:~:text=Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower%20,Europe%20during%20World%20War%20II)) ([Ronald Reagan: Biography, 40th U.S. President, Politician, Actor](https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan#:~:text=Ronald%20Reagan%3A%20Biography%2C%2040th%20U,Read%20about%20his%20movies%2C))】. Democrats, after some experimentation in the 1960s–70s, returned to emphasizing legal/government experience (perhaps valuing policy expertise and courtroom-honed debate skills). Meanwhile, Republicans increasingly capitalized on outsider appeal or military credentials (Reagan’s Hollywood charisma, George W. Bush’s MBA/business image, John McCain’s military service, Trump’s business fame). These choices illustrate how **the appeal of a candidate’s professional background has shifted with the times** – from lawyerly eloquence in the 19th century, to generalship in the mid-20th, to diverse forms of executive experience in the modern era.

## Success of Lawyers vs. Non-Lawyers  
Being a lawyer has not automatically made candidates more successful at winning elections – successful nominees have come from both groups. Overall, **lawyer nominees have a slight edge** in raw numbers of wins (lawyers have won 30 presidential elections vs. 17 wins by non-lawyers in major-party contests), but this is largely because lawyers were more common in the first place. In percentage terms, their win–loss rates are fairly close (about 54% for lawyers vs. 49% for non-lawyers, as shown in the table above). 

**Notably successful non-lawyers:** A number of non-lawyer candidates have won the presidency, often in pivotal elections. For example, **Dwight D. Eisenhower**, a five-star general with no legal or political office background, won back-to-back elections in the 1950s by wide margin ([Dwight D. Eisenhower | Biography, Cold War, Presidency, & Facts](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dwight-D-Eisenhower#:~:text=Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower%20,Europe%20during%20World%20War%20II))】. **Ronald Reagan**, the first former Hollywood actor to become president, won landslides in the 1980 ([Ronald Reagan: Biography, 40th U.S. President, Politician, Actor](https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan#:~:text=Ronald%20Reagan%3A%20Biography%2C%2040th%20U,Read%20about%20his%20movies%2C))】. More recently, **Donald Trump**, a businessman and television personality with no prior government service, won the 2016 electio ([History of Donald Trump | Humans - Vocal Media](https://vocal.media/humans/history-of-donald-trump#:~:text=History%20of%20Donald%20Trump%20,States%20from%202017%20to%202021))】. These victories show that voters have at times favored leadership experience outside the courtroom. In fact, during some periods (e.g. the 1950s and 1980s), having a non-lawyer “outsider” profile arguably enhanced a candidate’s appeal.

**Prominent lawyer-candidates (and outcomes):** Most U.S. presidents have indeed been lawyers by trade, from **Abraham Lincoln** (an Illinois attorney) to **Franklin D. Roosevelt** (who had practiced law in New York) to **Bill Clinton** (Yale Law graduate and Arkansas attorney general ([Which US Presidents Were Lawyers? - Legal Language Services](https://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/us-presidents-lawyers/#:~:text=Services%20www,follows%20in%20the%20footsteps))】. Many lawyer-candidates have been successful – e.g., **Woodrow Wilson** (won in 1912 and 1916, having briefly practiced law before academia), **Franklin D. Roosevelt** (won four terms, had legal training), and **Barack Obama** (won in 2008 and 2012, former law professor ([Which US Presidents Were Lawyers? - Legal Language Services](https://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/us-presidents-lawyers/#:~:text=Services%20www,follows%20in%20the%20footsteps))】. However, there have also been notable **lawyer nominees who lost** their races, indicating that a legal résumé was no guarantee of victory. For instance, **Charles Evans Hughes** (Republican, 1916) was a Supreme Court Justice yet narrowly lost to Wilson; **Adlai Stevenson II** (Democrat, 1952 and 1956) was a lawyer who lost twice to Eisenhower; and **Hillary Clinton** (Democrat, 2016) was a Yale-educated attorney who fell short against Trump. In contrast, some **non-lawyer candidates who lost** include **Barry Goldwater** (1964, a businessman/pilot) and **Al Smith** (1928, a career politician without a law degree), showing that non-legal background is also not a magic formula. In short, **electoral success has depended on many factors beyond profession** – war records, economic conditions, charisma, and campaign strategy – not just whether a candidate was a lawyer.

## Party Differences in Candidate Backgrounds  
When comparing the **Democratic vs. Republican** track records, clear differences emerge in different eras:

- **19th century:** Both parties (Democrats, and the Whigs/Republicans) favored lawyers. The Democrats especially were led by a **“lawyer-politician” class** (e.g. every Democratic president from 1828 to 1860 was an attorne ([Which U.S. Presidents Were Lawyers? - Civille](https://getciville.com/which-u-s-presidents-were-lawyers/#:~:text=Which%20U,John%20Tyler%20%C2%B7%20James))】). Republicans (founded in the 1850s) also leaned that way initially – their first successful candidate, **Lincoln**, was famously a lawyer. Thus, in the 1800s there wasn’t a stark partisan split on professions; being a lawyer was seen as the standard qualification for statesmanship in either party.

- **Early 20th century:** Still **no strong partisan divide** – both parties ran many lawyers, with a few exceptions in each. For example, in 1924 the Democrats nominated John W. Davis (a Wall Street lawyer) while Republicans had Calvin Coolidge (a lawyer ([List of presidents of the United States by previous experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_previous_experience#:~:text=List%20of%20presidents%20of%20the,presidents%20previously%20served%20as))】; in 1928, by contrast, Democrat Al Smith and Republican Herbert Hoover were both non-lawyers. Each party was willing to nominate a non-lawyer under the right circumstances, but lawyers were common on both tickets.

- **Late 20th century (post-1980):** A **partisan divergence** took hold. The **Democratic Party became much more likely to choose lawyers** – often individuals who built careers in law and then politics (e.g. Mondale, Dukakis, Clinton, Obama, Hillary Clinton, Biden all had legal careers). In these decades, *being a lawyer became almost a prerequisite for Democratic nominees*, perhaps reflecting the party’s emphasis on public service credentials and policy expertise. Meanwhile, the **Republican Party more frequently turned to non-lawyers**, tapping candidates with military service or business/outsider backgrounds (Reagan, the Bushes, McCain, Trump). By the 2000s, it was almost a party stereotype that **Democratic candidates were seasoned lawyers**, whereas **Republican candidates were often from outside the legal profession**. For instance, 2016 featured a contest between two starkly different résumés: Hillary Clinton, a former attorney and Secretary of State, versus Donald Trump, a businessman with no legal or government experienc ([History of Donald Trump | Humans - Vocal Media](https://vocal.media/humans/history-of-donald-trump#:~:text=History%20of%20Donald%20Trump%20,States%20from%202017%20to%202021))】. This partisan trend persists – in 2020, Democrats nominated Joe Biden (lawyer-turned-Senator) and Republicans renominated Trump (businessman). 

- **Impact on elections:** Neither party’s preference has proven universally superior in elections. Democrats won many races with lawyer-candidates (e.g. Clinton and Obama’s victories), but also lost in 2016 with a highly experienced lawyer (Clinton). Republicans won with non-lawyers like Eisenhower, Reagan, and Trump, but also lost in 1992 and 1996 with non-lawyers (George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole (though Dole was technically an attorney, his public image was more war hero/politician) losing to lawyer Clinton). The **1970s provide an interesting contrast**: the lawyer-heavy GOP lost in 1976 (Ford, a lawyer, lost to Carter, a non-lawyer), but the tables turned in 1980 when a non-lawyer Republican (Reagan) defeated a non-lawyer Democrat (Carter). These examples underscore that while the **professional makeup of candidates differs by party in modern times, success has depended on context**. Each party’s strategy has worked in some elections and failed in others.

## Conclusions and Historical Reflections  
Throughout U.S. history, **lawyers have been a mainstay of presidential politics**, especially in the republic’s first century. The early **“lawyer-statesman” archetype** set a lasting precedent – even today, many candidates hold law degrees as a badge of credibility. Over time, however, the appeal of *alternative career paths* grew. By the 20th century, Americans proved willing to elect engineers, soldiers, businessmen, and actors to the nation’s highest office. The **proportion of lawyer candidates has fluctuated by decade**, generally **declining in the mid-20th century** (as war hero generals and others entered the fray) and then **rising again for Democrats** late in the century, even as **Republicans moved the other way**. This divergence after WWII highlights how the two parties responded differently to social currents – one valuing institutional experience, the other often valuing outsider status or military leadership.

In terms of outcomes, *being a lawyer vs. not* has not decisively determined who wins the White House. **Lawyer candidates have won many elections – but so have non-lawyers**, especially when their personal story or the national mood favored an outsider. What is clear is that each era of U.S. history brought its own expectations for leadership. In the **19th century**, a grounding in law was seen as essential for navigating the young nation’s legal framewor ([The Long History of America’s Lawyer Presidents | Blog | Lawline](https://blog.lawline.com/the-long-history-of-americas-lawyer-presidents#:~:text=Many%20U,presidents))】. In the **20th century**, crises like World War II and the Cold War elevated candidates with military or executive skill ([Dwight D. Eisenhower | Biography, Cold War, Presidency, & Facts](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dwight-D-Eisenhower#:~:text=Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower%20,Europe%20during%20World%20War%20II))】. In the **21st century**, communication skills and outsider credibility (even reality TV fame) can propel a candidate without traditional credential ([History of Donald Trump | Humans - Vocal Media](https://vocal.media/humans/history-of-donald-trump#:~:text=History%20of%20Donald%20Trump%20,States%20from%202017%20to%202021))】. The major parties’ nominees reflect these shifting priorities. 

To summarize: **Democratic and Republican presidential candidates have evolved from almost uniformly lawyers in the 1800s to a mix of professions in recent decades.** Democrats today still lean into the tradition of the lawyer-politician (as seen with nominees like Obama and Biden), while Republicans have often broken from it (opting for candidates like Reagan and Trump). The success of any candidate, lawyer or not, has ultimately hinged on the person and the moment – not just their profession. The dynamic trends in candidates’ backgrounds offer a fascinating window into American political history, showing how each generation reinterprets the qualities deemed necessary to lead the nation.
