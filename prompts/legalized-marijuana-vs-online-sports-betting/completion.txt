# Comparative Negative Impacts: Legalized Marijuana vs. Online Sports Betting

## Introduction  
U.S. states are increasingly legalizing **recreational marijuana** and **online sports betting**, creating new industries and tax revenues. However, these changes also bring potential downsides. This analysis compares the negative impacts of each across three dimensions – economic, social, and health – drawing on the latest data and case studies from states that have legalized them. While both have benefits, understanding their costs is critical to assessing which poses a greater overall risk.

## Economic Impact  
Legalization of both marijuana and online sports betting has yielded significant revenue, but it also incurs costs related to healthcare, addiction treatment, and broader societal burdens. A key question is whether the new income truly offsets these costs in the long run.

- **Legalized Marijuana:** States have collected substantial tax revenue from cannabis (over **$20 billion** combined as of early 2024) ([Cannabis Tax Revenue in States that Regulate Cannabis for Adult ...](https://www.mpp.org/issues/legalization/cannabis-tax-revenue-states-regulate-cannabis-adult-use/#:~:text=Cannabis%20Tax%20Revenue%20in%20States,use%20cannabis%20sales)). In Colorado, for example, marijuana taxes in 2020 were about **$387 million**, roughly **0.98%** of the state budget ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8672945/#:~:text=Section%20V%3A%20Societal%20Impact)). However, studies suggest these revenues fall short of covering associated costs. One analysis found that *“for every $1 gained in tax revenue, Coloradans spent approximately $4.50 to mitigate the effects of legalization”* ([Economic and Social Costs of Legalized Marijuana - Centennial Institute](https://centennial.ccu.edu/briefs/marijuana-costs/#:~:text=Here%20are%20the%20important%20findings,from%20this%20report)). These costs include increased healthcare expenditures (e.g. treating cannabis-related injuries and addiction) and other societal expenses like public safety and education losses from high school dropouts ([Economic and Social Costs of Legalized Marijuana - Centennial Institute](https://centennial.ccu.edu/briefs/marijuana-costs/#:~:text=,of%20alcohol%20and%20other%20substances)). For instance, Colorado’s cannabis-related emergency needs surged after legalization – marijuana-related **ER visits jumped 52%** and hospitalizations **148%** (2012–2016) ([The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact](https://madd.org/hawaii/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/07/ImpactUpdate_ColoradoLeagaliztionMarijuana_10.18.pdf#:~:text=years%20after%20legalization,higher%20than%20the%20national%20average)) – straining healthcare systems. There are also productivity costs: heavy marijuana use correlates with lower workplace performance and more absenteeism, which can translate into lost economic output. Although legalization reduced law enforcement costs for minor possession offenses, states have had to invest in new regulation, public health campaigns, and addiction services. Importantly, much of marijuana’s economic benefit (jobs, business income, etc.) is **widely distributed**, whereas the costs (e.g. treatment for addiction or accidents) are concentrated among those directly affected ([Economic Benefits and Social Costs of Legalizing Recreational Marijuana](https://www.kansascityfed.org/Research%20Working%20Papers/documents/9825/rwp23-10browncohenfelix.pdf#:~:text=Although%20some%20of%20our%20estimates,concentrated%20costs%20indicate%20that%204)). In the long term, experts warn that the **health consequences of heavy cannabis use (e.g. chronic illness)** may drive costs even higher as the population ages ([Economic and Social Costs of Legalized Marijuana - Centennial Institute](https://centennial.ccu.edu/briefs/marijuana-costs/#:~:text=marijuana)).

- **Legalized Online Sports Betting:** The online sports betting boom has created a multi-billion-dollar market with significant cash flow – Americans have wagered around **$450 billion** on sports since 2018, generating nearly **$40 billion** in revenue for betting operators ([Are Americans Betting Their Future on Sports? Uncover the Surprising Stats](https://www.investopedia.com/americans-sports-betting-losing-8768618#:~:text=How%20Much%20Are%20Americans%20Losing,to%20Sports%20Betting)). This translates into tax dollars for states (for example, New Jersey’s online gambling brought in **$385 million** in state taxes in 2022 ([Study warns online gambling social costs could be "roughly equal" to New Jersey tax revenues | Yogonet International](https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/01/08/70299-study-warns-online-gambling-social-costs-could-be-34roughly-equal-34-to-new-jersey-tax-revenues#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20online%20casinos%20in,problems%20related%20to%20online%20gambling))). However, these gains are accompanied by serious economic downsides for individuals and communities. Because most bettors lose money (one study found **96% of 700,000 online gamblers** ended up in the red ([Legalized Gambling Increases Irresponsible Betting Behavior, Especially Among Low-Income Populations](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/legalized-gambling-increases-irresponsible-betting-behavior-especially-among-low-income-populations#:~:text=%E2%80%9COf%20the%20more%20than%20700%2C000,platforms%20often%20ban%20or%20throttle))), legalization effectively transfers wealth out of households into the gambling industry. Research shows that in states with legal sports betting, **household finances deteriorate**: savings and investments drop as gambling expenditures rise ([Are Americans Betting Their Future on Sports? Uncover the Surprising Stats](https://www.investopedia.com/americans-sports-betting-losing-8768618#:~:text=The%20researchers%20analyzed%20millions%20of,2%20fewer%20into%20investment%20accounts)). On average, for every **$1** a household spends on sports bets, it *reduces* its investments by **$2** ([Are Americans Betting Their Future on Sports? Uncover the Surprising Stats](https://www.investopedia.com/americans-sports-betting-losing-8768618#:~:text=The%20researchers%20analyzed%20millions%20of,2%20fewer%20into%20investment%20accounts)) – indicating bettors often forgo other financial priorities. Over a few years, this can snowball. A 2023 study found that within four years of a state legalizing online betting, **credit scores declined ~1%**, debt in collections jumped **8%**, and **bankruptcy filings soared 28%**, amounting to ~30,000 additional bankruptcies annually ([Are Americans Betting Their Future on Sports? Uncover the Surprising Stats](https://www.investopedia.com/americans-sports-betting-losing-8768618#:~:text=conclude%20in%20their%20working%20paper)). These are profound long-term financial impacts on individuals. At the state level, economists in New Jersey estimate that the **social costs of online gambling (healthcare, social services, homelessness, etc.) could reach $350 million**, nearly matching the state’s tax revenue intake ([Study warns online gambling social costs could be "roughly equal" to New Jersey tax revenues | Yogonet International](https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/01/08/70299-study-warns-online-gambling-social-costs-could-be-34roughly-equal-34-to-new-jersey-tax-revenues#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20online%20casinos%20in,problems%20related%20to%20online%20gambling)). In fact, when factoring broader economic effects, New Jersey’s experience suggests online gambling may even be a net drag on the economy – about **$180 million** in economic activity was lost in 2022 due to consumer dollars flowing into online wagering instead of other local spending ([Study warns online gambling social costs could be "roughly equal" to New Jersey tax revenues | Yogonet International](https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/01/08/70299-study-warns-online-gambling-social-costs-could-be-34roughly-equal-34-to-new-jersey-tax-revenues#:~:text=The%20research%20showed%20that%20the,it%20by%20approximately%20%24180%20million)) ([Study warns online gambling social costs could be "roughly equal" to New Jersey tax revenues | Yogonet International](https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/01/08/70299-study-warns-online-gambling-social-costs-could-be-34roughly-equal-34-to-new-jersey-tax-revenues#:~:text=New%20Jersey%2C%20a%20forerunner%20in,the%20economic%20benefits%20of%20legalization)). In summary, while sports betting does generate revenue and jobs, the **financial harms (addictive losses, debt, bankruptcies)** can offset those gains or impose new costs (like the need for expanded financial counseling and social support programs). The long-term picture shows many individuals worse off financially, raising concerns that the supposed “economic upside” of online betting may be illusory once societal costs are accounted for ([Study warns online gambling social costs could be "roughly equal" to New Jersey tax revenues | Yogonet International](https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/01/08/70299-study-warns-online-gambling-social-costs-could-be-34roughly-equal-34-to-new-jersey-tax-revenues#:~:text=New%20Jersey%2C%20a%20forerunner%20in,the%20economic%20benefits%20of%20legalization)) ([Study warns online gambling social costs could be "roughly equal" to New Jersey tax revenues | Yogonet International](https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/01/08/70299-study-warns-online-gambling-social-costs-could-be-34roughly-equal-34-to-new-jersey-tax-revenues#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20online%20casinos%20in,problems%20related%20to%20online%20gambling)).

**Comparison:** Both industries create new revenue streams but also new burdens. Marijuana’s economic negatives tend to manifest in **public sector costs** (healthcare, safety, etc.) and lost productivity, whereas sports betting’s costs often hit **individual finances and wealth**. In legalized marijuana states, taxpayers may shoulder increased public health and safety expenses that can outweigh pot tax revenues ([Economic and Social Costs of Legalized Marijuana - Centennial Institute](https://centennial.ccu.edu/briefs/marijuana-costs/#:~:text=Here%20are%20the%20important%20findings,from%20this%20report)). In sports betting states, many citizens are draining personal savings and racking up debt, which can ripple out to the economy (through bankruptcies, lower consumer spending, etc.) ([Are Americans Betting Their Future on Sports? Uncover the Surprising Stats](https://www.investopedia.com/americans-sports-betting-losing-8768618#:~:text=conclude%20in%20their%20working%20paper)) ([Are Americans Betting Their Future on Sports? Uncover the Surprising Stats](https://www.investopedia.com/americans-sports-betting-losing-8768618#:~:text=The%20researchers%20analyzed%20millions%20of,2%20fewer%20into%20investment%20accounts)). Notably, the pace and scale of personal financial loss from online gambling have been swift – exemplified by sharp rises in debt and bankruptcy within just a few years ([Are Americans Betting Their Future on Sports? Uncover the Surprising Stats](https://www.investopedia.com/americans-sports-betting-losing-8768618#:~:text=conclude%20in%20their%20working%20paper)). By contrast, marijuana’s financial impact, positive or negative, has been more gradual and diffuse. Overall, when it comes to pure economic risk, **online sports betting poses a more direct threat to household finances**, whereas marijuana’s toll is seen in public health expenditures and potentially long-run productivity losses. The net societal cost of gambling may also be more **immediate and quantifiable**, roughly equating to its tax benefits in some analyses ([Study warns online gambling social costs could be "roughly equal" to New Jersey tax revenues | Yogonet International](https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/01/08/70299-study-warns-online-gambling-social-costs-could-be-34roughly-equal-34-to-new-jersey-tax-revenues#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20online%20casinos%20in,problems%20related%20to%20online%20gambling)), whereas the net fiscal impact of marijuana legalization is mixed but generally modest for state budgets ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8672945/#:~:text=Section%20V%3A%20Societal%20Impact)). 

## Social Impact  
Legal marijuana and online sports betting each influence social dynamics, affecting crime rates, family life, and vulnerable groups. Key questions include how legalization alters criminal activity, how it affects youth and low-income populations, and whether it leads to more problematic behaviors that strain society.

- **Legalized Marijuana:** The social outcomes of marijuana legalization are complex. On one hand, decriminalization has led to far fewer arrests for simple possession, alleviating some burdens on the justice system and individuals’ records. On the other hand, some data indicate **increases in certain crimes and social problems**. In Colorado, which pioneered recreational sales, *violent crime* rose by **18.6%** and *property crime* by **8.3%** in the years following legalization ([The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact](https://madd.org/hawaii/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/07/ImpactUpdate_ColoradoLeagaliztionMarijuana_10.18.pdf#:~:text=years%20after%20legalization,higher%20than%20the%20national%20average)). Overall crime rates have not spiked dramatically in most legalization states, but Colorado’s experience suggests at least a moderate uptick in crime that might be associated with the drug trade (e.g. robberies or illegal market activity that persists alongside the legal market). Additionally, legalized marijuana has attracted an influx of people to early-adopting states, including transients drawn by the industry or easy access. Colorado saw a **35% increase in chronic homelessness** after legalization (anecdotally attributed in part to migrants arriving for marijuana) ([Economic Benefits and Social Costs of Legalizing Recreational Marijuana](https://www.kansascityfed.org/Research%20Working%20Papers/documents/9825/rwp23-10browncohenfelix.pdf#:~:text=rose%2C%20suggesting%20a%20potential%20increase,in%20states%20with%20legalized%20marijuana)). This has strained social services and shelters in some communities. Family dynamics can also be affected. Greater adult use of marijuana can lead to more instances of impairment at home, which may contribute to neglect or conflict. There have been **more cases of children accidentally ingesting cannabis products** since legalization – marijuana exposures reported to poison control **more than tripled** in Colorado after legal sales began ([The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact](https://madd.org/hawaii/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/07/ImpactUpdate_ColoradoLeagaliztionMarijuana_10.18.pdf#:~:text=years%20after%20legalization,higher%20than%20the%20national%20average)) – which can disrupt families and require emergency intervention. **Youth and low-income groups** are often cited as vulnerable populations. While most legal states set 21 as the minimum age, increased adult use and commercial availability may normalize the drug and indirectly make it more accessible to teens. Survey data on adolescent use are mixed – one report noted Colorado’s *youth (12–17) past-month marijuana use* actually **fell 22%** post-legalization, yet it remains ~39% higher than the national average ([
            The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact: Volume 8, September 2021 - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8672945/#:~:text=,rd%7D%20in%20the%20nation)). This suggests legalization didn’t cause a teen use explosion, but teen use was already elevated and still needs attention. Marijuana use is particularly risky for youth, as it can interfere with brain development and academic performance. Communities of lower socioeconomic status also bear a disproportionate share of marijuana’s social burdens. Cannabis use rates are higher among less-educated adults ([Economic and Social Costs of Legalized Marijuana - Centennial Institute](https://centennial.ccu.edu/briefs/marijuana-costs/#:~:text=,and%20legalization%20of%20recreational%20marijuana)), and heavy use can perpetuate cycles of poverty (through diminished motivation or legal troubles). In sum, marijuana’s social impact includes **fewer petty crime arrests but potentially more public health and safety incidents** – such as drugged driving crashes, workplace accidents, or domestic problems when dependency sets in. Many localities remain wary: about **two-thirds of Colorado jurisdictions banned** marijuana businesses in their area ([
            The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact: Volume 8, September 2021 - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8672945/#:~:text=,of%20Colorado%E2%80%99s%20FY%202020%20budget)), reflecting community concerns about protecting social order and youth.

- **Legalized Online Sports Betting:** The social implications of widespread online gambling are significant and still unfolding. One immediate effect has been a surge in **problematic gambling behavior**, which ripples into crime and family life. Unlike brick-and-mortar casinos, online sportsbooks are accessible 24/7 from home or on one’s phone, which has led to a rapid increase in gambling participation. As of 2023, over *half of American adults* (146 million people) live in a state with legal sports betting, and young adults in their 20s – the demographic most prone to risk-taking – are heavily targeted by sportsbook advertising ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%20the%20year%20New,consuming%20in%20their%20lives)) ([Microsoft Word - MSU Center for DASGR- Problem Gambling Report Feb 14 2024.docx](https://www.morgan.edu/Documents/ADMINISTRATION/CENTERS/DASG/MSU%20Center%20for%20DASGR-%20Problem%20Gambling%20Report%20Feb%2014%202024.pdf#:~:text=Maryland%27s%20gambling%20landscape%20faces%20the,generate%20substantial%20gaming%20tax%20revenue)). The result is that many more people are gambling frequently, including those least equipped to handle the losses. States that have legalized have seen **steep rises in gambling addiction indicators**. New Jersey, an early adopter (2018), experienced a **277% increase in calls** to its problem gambling helpline in the first six years after legalization ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%20the%20year%20New,consuming%20in%20their%20lives)). Notably, the *majority of callers are now young men* whose sports betting “has become all-consuming” ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%20the%20year%20New,consuming%20in%20their%20lives)), reflecting how aggressively online betting has drawn in younger gamblers. Other states report similar trends: Michigan’s helpline calls quintupled just one month after launching mobile betting ([Microsoft Word - MSU Center for DASGR- Problem Gambling Report Feb 14 2024.docx](https://www.morgan.edu/Documents/ADMINISTRATION/CENTERS/DASG/MSU%20Center%20for%20DASGR-%20Problem%20Gambling%20Report%20Feb%2014%202024.pdf#:~:text=Connecticut%27s%20Helpline%20Surge%3A%20In%20Connecticut%2C,Gambling%20Addiction%3A%20the%20Relationship%20Between)), and **Connecticut’s helpline calls tripled within six months** of debuting online sportsbooks ([Microsoft Word - MSU Center for DASGR- Problem Gambling Report Feb 14 2024.docx](https://www.morgan.edu/Documents/ADMINISTRATION/CENTERS/DASG/MSU%20Center%20for%20DASGR-%20Problem%20Gambling%20Report%20Feb%2014%202024.pdf#:~:text=Connecticut%27s%20Helpline%20Surge%3A%20In%20Connecticut%2C,Gambling%20Addiction%3A%20the%20Relationship%20Between)). This wave of new gambling addicts can lead to various social ills. **Family dynamics** often suffer when someone develops a gambling problem – financial secrecy, mounting debts, and obsessive time spent betting can erode trust and stability at home. Many problem gamblers resort to lies or even theft from family members to cover losses. In severe cases, households can lose savings, homes, or relationships due to gambling-driven financial ruin. Unlike marijuana (where impairment can directly cause public disturbances or accidents), gambling’s harm is often **hidden until crisis**, which means families might be blindsided by bankruptcies or legal troubles stemming from a bettor’s actions. There is also a link between problem gambling and other harmful behaviors: gamblers with big losses may turn to crime (e.g. embezzlement, fraud) to recoup money or to substance abuse to cope with stress. While comprehensive crime statistics are still emerging, law enforcement in several states have reported incidents of theft or fraud tied to gambling debts. Socially, **low-income and minority communities** are particularly vulnerable. Research indicates online betting legalization led to **more “irresponsible gambling” among lower-income bettors** – nearly half of online gamblers making under $35K per year exceeded recommended limits, spending over 1% of their income on betting, and about **5% spent more than 10% of their monthly income** on gambling ([Legalized Gambling Increases Irresponsible Betting Behavior, Especially Among Low-Income Populations](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/legalized-gambling-increases-irresponsible-betting-behavior-especially-among-low-income-populations#:~:text=For%20around%20250%2C000%20participants%2C%20researchers,of%20their%20monthly%20pay)). This can exacerbate poverty and inequality, as those who can least afford losses are enticed into high-frequency betting. Additionally, **young people** are being socialized into gambling through constant advertising tie-ins with sports. Even underage teens are at risk – surveys show that teens and college students have higher rates of gambling than adults (often via fantasy sports or informal betting), which could presage a new generation of gambling addicts ([Problem gamblers have highest suicide rate among addicts, studies show](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/problem-gamblers-have-highest-suicide-rate-of-any-addiction-disorder-studies-show#:~:text=Of%20Ohioans%20that%20participate%20in,for%20other%20gambling)). The normalization of sports gambling might also affect social cohesion: sports fandom communities are now saturated with betting talk, and the line between a fun pastime and compulsive behavior is blurring. Concerned by these trends, experts are calling for more robust social safeguards (education, gambling addiction programs) to keep pace with the rapid expansion ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=and%20explore%20different%20aspects%20of,a%20personal%20and%20clinical%20perspective)) ([Legalized Gambling Increases Irresponsible Betting Behavior, Especially Among Low-Income Populations](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/legalized-gambling-increases-irresponsible-betting-behavior-especially-among-low-income-populations#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20tried%20to%20collect%20as,%E2%80%9D)). In summary, online sports betting has triggered a **sharp rise in problematic behavior** – with more gambling addiction, financial crime, and family strife – especially impacting **younger males and economically vulnerable groups**. The social fabric could be strained as more people spiral into addiction and debt, highlighting a need for proactive measures.

**Comparison:** Both legal marijuana and sports betting raise social concerns, but in different ways. Marijuana’s social impact manifests in **public safety and community health** issues: some increased crime and homelessness, potential youth exposure, and the challenges of integrating a once-illicit drug into daily life. Online sports betting’s social impact is characterized by a rapid **proliferation of addictive behavior** that is financially destructive and often hidden until it’s severe. In terms of *crime*, marijuana legalization eliminated many low-level drug crimes but has seen a modest rise in other offenses in some states ([The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact](https://madd.org/hawaii/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/07/ImpactUpdate_ColoradoLeagaliztionMarijuana_10.18.pdf#:~:text=Section%20II%3A%20Marijuana%20Use%20%EF%82%B7,higher%20than%20the%20national%20average)). Sports betting, by contrast, doesn’t overtly increase street crime, but can drive white-collar crimes and domestic problems due to gambling debts. Regarding *vulnerable populations*, both target young adults – cannabis companies via potent products and colorful marketing, and sportsbooks via ubiquitous ads and promotions – raising worries about youth normalization. However, the data suggest the **most pronounced social disruption so far comes from online betting’s addiction surge**, which has flooded hotlines and treatment programs ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%20the%20year%20New,consuming%20in%20their%20lives)). Marijuana’s social risks, while real (e.g. impaired driving and school dropouts), have been somewhat tempered by regulation and education, and teen use has not spiked in most areas ([
            The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact: Volume 8, September 2021 - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8672945/#:~:text=,rd%7D%20in%20the%20nation)). In contrast, gambling’s accessibility explosion caught many by surprise, with **helpline calls spiking 200–300%** and families suddenly facing severe financial crises ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%20the%20year%20New,consuming%20in%20their%20lives)). In sum, marijuana might pose a broader public order challenge (balancing legal use with community impacts), whereas sports betting presents an **addiction-fueled social crisis** that is mounting quickly among certain demographics. 

## Health-Related Impact  
The physical and mental health consequences of marijuana use and sports betting differ in nature. Marijuana directly affects physical health (e.g. respiratory system, cognitive function) and can lead to substance addiction. Sports betting primarily affects mental health, contributing to stress-related disorders and addiction behaviors, which in turn can have secondary physical effects. Both put pressure on health and emergency services in different ways.

- **Legalized Marijuana:** As a psychoactive substance, marijuana carries several health risks that have become more evident post-legalization. **Addiction** is a concern: roughly 9–15% of users may develop cannabis use disorder, and legalization has been linked to higher addiction prevalence. In states that legalized recreational use, the rate of adult *substance use disorders* (including CUD) increased by about **17%** on average ([Economic Benefits and Social Costs of Legalizing Recreational Marijuana](https://www.kansascityfed.org/Research%20Working%20Papers/documents/9825/rwp23-10browncohenfelix.pdf#:~:text=by%2028%20per%02cent,without%20significant%20increases%20in%20crime)). More people are using cannabis daily, and the potency of THC in products has risen, potentially heightening the risk of dependence and psychiatric effects. **Physical health** issues from chronic marijuana use include respiratory problems (chronic bronchitis, coughing, lung irritation) for those who smoke it. Long-term heavy use has also been associated with cardiovascular strain (e.g. higher heart rate, in rare cases triggering cardiac events) and a syndrome of cyclical vomiting known as cannabinoid hyperemesis. Legalization has led to more medical emergencies involving marijuana. Colorado’s hospitals saw **marijuana-related ER visits and hospitalizations soar** in the years after legalization ([The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact](https://madd.org/hawaii/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/07/ImpactUpdate_ColoradoLeagaliztionMarijuana_10.18.pdf#:~:text=years%20after%20legalization,higher%20than%20the%20national%20average)). By 2020, the state recorded a **185% increase in cannabis-only exposure cases** (often young children or pets ingesting edibles) compared to 2013 ([
            The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact: Volume 8, September 2021 - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8672945/#:~:text=Section%20III%3A%20Public%20Health)). These incidents directly impact emergency services and poison control centers, which have had to handle many more overdose-like situations (though marijuana overdose is rarely fatal, overconsumption can cause acute panic, psychotic episodes, or severe vomiting requiring medical care). Another health impact is on **traffic safety**: driving under the influence of marijuana is known to impair motor skills and reaction time. After legalization, the proportion of traffic accident fatalities in Colorado where the driver tested positive for marijuana roughly doubled – marijuana was involved in about **20% of traffic deaths** by 2020, up from 11% before legal sales ([

This indicates more stoned driving, which endangers not only the users but others on the road. **Mental health** effects of cannabis are a subject of intense study. High-THC marijuana can acutely cause paranoia or anxiety, and in susceptible individuals it may trigger psychotic symptoms. Some research noted an increase in *psychosis cases* presenting to hospitals following legalization, though causation is hard to establish. In Colorado, the share of *suicide victims with marijuana in their system* climbed from 14% in 2013 to **29% in 2020** ([

This does not prove cannabis caused those suicides, but it highlights a correlation between heavy use and mental distress. Cannabis use, especially in adolescents, has been linked to higher risk of depression and schizophrenia in later years ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6397076/#:~:text=Problematic%20cannabis%20use%20%28e,controlled)). Furthermore, chronic use can impair memory, concentration, and motivation (the “amotivational syndrome”), potentially affecting school or job performance and thereby mental well-being. From a public health perspective, marijuana legalization has required expanded resources: treatment programs for cannabis addiction (though paradoxically Colorado saw treatment admissions drop as usage rose, possibly because users don’t seek help voluntarily ([

The long-term health toll of widespread marijuana use remains somewhat uncertain – as one report noted, it may take decades to fully understand and it could mirror the delayed harms seen with tobacco ([Economic and Social Costs of Legalized Marijuana - Centennial Institute](https://centennial.ccu.edu/briefs/marijuana-costs/#:~:text=marijuana)). Still, early data from legalization states show **clear increases in acute health issues** (ER visits, poisonings, impaired driving crashes), which directly draw on emergency services and public health resources.

- **Legalized Online Sports Betting:** Unlike substances, gambling doesn’t directly damage organs or cause intoxication, but it can severely impact **mental health** and indirectly affect physical health via stress. The foremost health issue from online sports betting is **addiction (gambling disorder)** – a behavioral addiction recognized by psychiatrists. The ease of placing bets online has made gambling far more accessible, increasing the number of people who develop addictive patterns. **Addiction rates** are climbing: nationally about 1% of U.S. adults are estimated to have a severe gambling problem, but in states with ubiquitous online betting, the percentage with at least some gambling problem is higher (New Jersey surveys found ~5–6% of adults exhibiting risky or problem gambling behavior in recent years ([Problem gamblers have highest suicide rate among addicts, studies show](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/problem-gamblers-have-highest-suicide-rate-of-any-addiction-disorder-studies-show#:~:text=Of%20Ohioans%20that%20participate%20in,for%20other%20gambling))). Gambling addiction often co-occurs with other mental health issues. Studies indicate **up to 96% of problem gamblers have at least one additional psychiatric disorder** (commonly depression, anxiety, or substance abuse) ([How gambling affects the brain and who is most vulnerable to ...](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/07/how-gambling-affects-the-brain#:~:text=,control)). The act of betting triggers dopamine in the brain’s reward pathways similarly to drugs, which can lead to a compulsive cycle. As people chase losses, they may experience extreme stress, despair, and loss of control – all hallmarks of deteriorating mental health. **Stress-related disorders** linked to problem gambling include severe anxiety, depression, insomnia, and even trauma (some gamblers describe panic attacks or PTSD-like symptoms from financial ruin). The toll on mental health can be seen in the surge of people seeking help: crisis hotlines and rehab centers have noted a significant uptick in gambling-related cases post-legalization ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%20the%20year%20New,consuming%20in%20their%20lives)). Unfortunately, many sufferers hide their problem until it becomes a crisis, so they often present to healthcare providers with advanced issues like suicidal ideation or acute anxiety. Indeed, gambling addiction is considered to have the **highest suicide rate of any addiction**. Roughly **1 in 5 pathological gamblers** attempts suicide at some point – a rate higher than that for alcoholism or drug dependence ([Problem gamblers have highest suicide rate among addicts, studies show](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/problem-gamblers-have-highest-suicide-rate-of-any-addiction-disorder-studies-show#:~:text=The%202017%20Report%20on%20Problem,of%20developing%20a%20gambling%20problem)). This alarming statistic underscores the gravity of the mental health impact. Even where expanded sports betting hasn’t yet driven up the general suicide rate ([Legalized Gambling Increases Irresponsible Betting Behavior, Especially Among Low-Income Populations](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/legalized-gambling-increases-irresponsible-betting-behavior-especially-among-low-income-populations#:~:text=Study%20authors%20found%20gambling%20helpline,not%20observe%20decedents%E2%80%99%20gambling%20activity)), the *personal risk* to individuals is high. Many suicides or suicide attempts have been linked to overwhelming gambling debts and feelings of hopelessness. In terms of **physical health**, chronic stress from gambling losses can lead to hypertension, ulcers, migraines, heart problems, and other stress-exacerbated conditions. Some problem gamblers neglect their health, skip meals or medications, or suffer sleep deprivation during betting binges, further harming their bodies. Additionally, gambling binges often coincide with substance use (e.g. binge drinking while watching games), compounding health risks. For emergency services, the impact of gambling is less direct than a drug overdose but still present. Hospitals may see admissions for stress-induced chest pains or panic attacks that ultimately trace back to gambling. Mental health clinics and addiction counselors are facing **greater caseloads of gambling disorder patients**, requiring specialized training and resources. The public health system is now adapting to this relatively new addiction on a large scale – for example, some states are funneling a portion of betting tax revenue into gambling addiction treatment and prevention programs ([Are Americans Betting Their Future on Sports? Uncover the Surprising Stats](https://www.investopedia.com/americans-sports-betting-losing-8768618#:~:text=filings%20within%20four%20years.%20,funding%20for%20responsible%20gambling%20initiatives)). The need for such programs has become evident with the explosive growth of mobile betting. **Expert projections** warn that as online sports betting continues to expand (now legal in 30+ states and counting), the incidence of gambling-related mental health crises will keep rising ([Legalized Gambling Increases Irresponsible Betting Behavior, Especially Among Low-Income Populations](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/legalized-gambling-increases-irresponsible-betting-behavior-especially-among-low-income-populations#:~:text=show%20sustained%20upward%20trends%20in,year%20time%20period)) ([Legalized Gambling Increases Irresponsible Betting Behavior, Especially Among Low-Income Populations](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/legalized-gambling-increases-irresponsible-betting-behavior-especially-among-low-income-populations#:~:text=The%20authors%20conclude%20that%20legalized,%E2%80%9D)). Without intervention, we could see more cases of severe depression, family violence, or suicide stemming from betting problems. In sum, the health impacts of online sports betting are primarily psychological but no less devastating – **addiction, emotional distress, and self-harm risks** have all climbed, placing a new strain on mental health services and highlighting that gambling is as much a public health issue as it is an economic or legal one.

**Comparison:** Health-wise, marijuana and online sports betting represent two different kinds of risk – one largely **physiological** and the other **psychological**. Legal marijuana’s negative health effects are tangible in emergency rooms (treating overdoses, injuries, intoxicated driving crashes) and in long-term chronic illness management (addiction, lung and mental health problems). It directly engages public health resources – for example, more traffic accidents mean more EMS and trauma care, and more cannabis poisonings mean more poison control and pediatric ER visits ([The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact](https://madd.org/hawaii/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/07/ImpactUpdate_ColoradoLeagaliztionMarijuana_10.18.pdf#:~:text=years%20after%20legalization,higher%20than%20the%20national%20average)). Online sports betting’s health impacts, while not physically immediate, manifest in a creeping mental health crisis that can be just as costly and tragic. Problem gambling can lead to **clinical depression, anxiety disorders, and even life-threatening situations like suicidal behavior** ([Problem gamblers have highest suicide rate among addicts, studies show](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/problem-gamblers-have-highest-suicide-rate-of-any-addiction-disorder-studies-show#:~:text=The%202017%20Report%20on%20Problem,of%20developing%20a%20gambling%20problem)). These conditions require substantial healthcare support (psychiatric care, counseling, potentially medications) and can overflow into physical health emergencies (stress-induced ailments). One notable difference is visibility: someone driving while high or experiencing a cannabis-related panic attack is visible to first responders, whereas a gambling addict’s suffering is often hidden until a breaking point, which might be a suicide attempt or a collapse from stress. From a public health planning perspective, marijuana’s impact is more **acute but manageable** (e.g. ensuring ER capacity, improving DUI prevention), whereas gambling’s impact is more **chronic and diffuse**, requiring investment in mental health infrastructure and preventative education. Both issues demonstrate that legalization without adequate safeguards can overwhelm health systems – Colorado’s example showed dramatic increases in drug-related emergencies ([
            The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: The Impact: Volume 8, September 2021 - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8672945/#:~:text=Section%20III%3A%20Public%20Health)), and states with online betting have seen treatment demand spike sharply ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%20the%20year%20New,consuming%20in%20their%20lives)). Overall, marijuana poses greater **direct physical health risks** (accidents, respiratory issues, etc.), while sports betting poses greater **indirect and mental health risks**, including one of the highest addiction-suicide linkages known ([Problem gamblers have highest suicide rate among addicts, studies show](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/problem-gamblers-have-highest-suicide-rate-of-any-addiction-disorder-studies-show#:~:text=The%202017%20Report%20on%20Problem,of%20developing%20a%20gambling%20problem)). Each forces emergency and healthcare services to adapt: ambulance and ER crews for cannabis incidents, and crisis counselors and financial therapists for gambling cases. Neither set of health impacts is trivial, but their nature differs fundamentally.

## Conclusion: Which Poses the Greater Risk?  
Both legalized marijuana and legalized online sports betting come with significant negative impacts – economically, socially, and health-wise – that temper their perceived benefits. **Marijuana legalization** has introduced public health challenges (more ER visits, addiction cases, and impaired driving accidents) and some social costs (like higher homelessness and localized crime increases), but its harms tend to be concentrated among heavy users and can be mitigated with robust public health strategies ([Economic Benefits and Social Costs of Legalizing Recreational Marijuana](https://www.kansascityfed.org/Research%20Working%20Papers/documents/9825/rwp23-10browncohenfelix.pdf#:~:text=Although%20some%20of%20our%20estimates,concentrated%20costs%20indicate%20that%204)). **Online sports betting**, on the other hand, has rapidly woven itself into the fabric of daily life and is unleashing a wave of financial and mental health crises across a broad swath of the population. The data suggest that the **greater overall risk to the U.S. comes from legalized online sports betting**. The reasoning is multifold: 

- **Economic Toll:** Sports betting is essentially a negative-sum game for consumers – billions of dollars are being siphoned from households, leading to spikes in personal debt and bankruptcy that marijuana use, for all its issues, does not typically cause ([Are Americans Betting Their Future on Sports? Uncover the Surprising Stats](https://www.investopedia.com/americans-sports-betting-losing-8768618#:~:text=conclude%20in%20their%20working%20paper)). The long-term financial fallout (e.g. lost investments, credit problems) can undermine economic stability for families and communities, potentially on a larger scale than the economic externalities of marijuana.

- **Addiction and Social Disruption:** While marijuana can be addictive and harmful, problem gambling is exploding at an unparalleled rate, with helplines inundated by new cases ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%20the%20year%20New,consuming%20in%20their%20lives)). Gambling addiction’s ability to destroy finances, careers, and relationships in a short time – often silently – makes it a particularly dangerous social scourge. The fact that online betting actively targets vulnerable groups (young adults, low-income individuals) with sophisticated marketing is exacerbating these harms ([Surge in Sports Betting to be Explored at NJ Compulsive Gambling Conference  - NJBIA](https://njbia.org/surge-in-sports-betting-to-be-explored-at-nj-compulsive-gambling-conference/#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%20the%20year%20New,consuming%20in%20their%20lives)) ([Legalized Gambling Increases Irresponsible Betting Behavior, Especially Among Low-Income Populations](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/legalized-gambling-increases-irresponsible-betting-behavior-especially-among-low-income-populations#:~:text=For%20around%20250%2C000%20participants%2C%20researchers,of%20their%20monthly%20pay)). Marijuana’s societal impacts, in contrast, have been relatively more contained and are offset somewhat by reductions in drug arrests and the illicit market.

- **Health Impact:** Both present serious health concerns, but gambling’s link to extreme mental distress (including suicide attempts) ([Problem gamblers have highest suicide rate among addicts, studies show](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/problem-gamblers-have-highest-suicide-rate-of-any-addiction-disorder-studies-show#:~:text=The%202017%20Report%20on%20Problem,of%20developing%20a%20gambling%20problem)) arguably represents a more acute threat in terms of preventable loss of life. Marijuana’s health risks, though important (e.g. accidents and potential long-term cognitive effects), are better understood and can be moderated through regulation (e.g. potency limits, public education). The sudden rise in stress-related disorders tied to online betting and the lack of an existing robust treatment infrastructure for gambling addiction means many Americans are at risk of falling through the cracks.

In weighing these factors, legalized online sports betting emerges as the **greater risk** to the U.S. at this time. Its negative impacts have scaled up faster and seem poised to affect a larger portion of the population in a materially harmful way. By contrast, the challenges from legalized marijuana, while significant, have been more incremental and, in some areas, amenable to policy adjustments (such as improved road safety campaigns or youth prevention programs). This is not to downplay marijuana’s risks – indeed, states must remain vigilant and address the rising healthcare and safety costs associated with cannabis use ([

However, if one must be deemed a greater threat based on current evidence, the **online sports betting wave – with its financial wreckage and mental health fallout – presents a more immediate and pervasive menace**. Policymakers would be wise to treat it as a public health emergency in the making, investing in stronger protections and resources, lest the “gambling gold rush” turn into a long-term social crisis ([Study warns online gambling social costs could be "roughly equal" to New Jersey tax revenues | Yogonet International](https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/01/08/70299-study-warns-online-gambling-social-costs-could-be-34roughly-equal-34-to-new-jersey-tax-revenues#:~:text=New%20Jersey%2C%20a%20forerunner%20in,the%20economic%20benefits%20of%20legalization)) ([Study warns online gambling social costs could be "roughly equal" to New Jersey tax revenues | Yogonet International](https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2024/01/08/70299-study-warns-online-gambling-social-costs-could-be-34roughly-equal-34-to-new-jersey-tax-revenues#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20online%20casinos%20in,problems%20related%20to%20online%20gambling)).

These provide the empirical backbone for the comparative assessment. Ultimately, both vices require careful regulation and public health intervention, but the **scope and speed of online sports betting’s negative impacts** make it the more formidable risk facing the U.S. today.
