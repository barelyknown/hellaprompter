Why is it rational for the individuals to forgo optionality and obligate themselves to their spouse and new family? How did evolution cause humans in all cultures to adopt marriage as a norm?

  "sceneDescription": "A couple in wedding attire stands in a modest living room. The bride cradles an infant, while the groom sets down a small suitcase spilling out tokens of carefree adventures. Through a window, multiple winding paths stretch into the distance, but the couple appears calm and focused on each other. In the background, faint silhouettes of extended family form a protective arc. The scene suggests a deliberate choice—sacrificing open-ended possibilities in favor of investing in each other and their child.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "1\n\nI chose Illustration 1 because it effectively captures the essence of sacrifice and commitment in marriage. The overflowing suitcase with tokens of past adventures juxtaposes with the calm focus on the child, highlighting a rational choice to forgo options. The silhouetted family and multiple paths through the window reinforce the protective and evolving nature of marriage, aligning with the article's themes. The style and composition are characteristic of a New Yorker cartoon, with subtle humor and strong artistic quality."
