  "sceneDescription": "A fresh, white-walled living room is virtually empty except for two people kneeling near a pile of ornate picture frames, patterned wallpaper rolls, and mismatched textiles spilling out of open boxes. They hold up a large, lavishly framed painting that dwarfs them, clearly uncertain about which wall to hang it on first. One corner of the room features a dramatically large velvet armchair, while rugs overlap in haphazard layers on the floor, suggesting a budding collection of flamboyant, evolving decor poised to fill every corner.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "1. This illustration best captures the essence of the maximalist style. The abundance of frames, the ornate details on the picture frame and chair, and the overlapping rugs effectively convey the theme of “more is more.” The visual composition is clear and dynamically arranged, capturing both the uncertainty and excitement of decorating a new space. Additionally, the artistic quality and clever subtle humor embody the New Yorker cartoon style, making it the most fitting choice.",
