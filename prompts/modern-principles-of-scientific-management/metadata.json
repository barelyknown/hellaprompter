  "sceneDescription": "A large conference table dominates an open-plan office, where managers in neat suits fuss over tiny piles of paper scraps and calculator readouts. Nearby, a row of employees sits in identical cubicles, each gazing blankly at computer screens with half-finished tasks open. Stacks of unopened manuals tower behind them like unused potential. On the wall, a massive clock looms, its hands creeping forward. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, a bright city skyline hints at endless possibility waiting just beyond the glass.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "3\n\nIllustration 3 captures the essence of the modern workplace with an emphasis on stacks of unused manuals and the looming clock, reflecting the theme of wasted human talent. The detailed depiction of both managers and employees, combined with the city skyline, mirrors the article's message about untapped potential and efficiency. The style is in line with New Yorker's sophistication and humor, blending clarity with subtle commentary.",
