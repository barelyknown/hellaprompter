# Negotiating Commission Splits in Joint Enterprise SaaS Deals: Pros, Cons & Alternatives

When enterprise SaaS sales involve multiple salespeople on one deal, how to split the commission is a critical decision. **Commission splits**, if designed well, can encourage teamwork and reward everyone’s contributions, but if handled poorly they become “a painful source of distraction and lost productivity” ([Best practice guidance for using Sales Commission Splits](https://www.netcommissions.com/blog/bid/172969/Best-practice-guidance-for-using-Sales-Commission-Splits#:~:text=As%20with%20most%20elements%20of,customer%20facing%20field%20sales%20teams)). Below we analyze the pros and cons of **allowing sales reps to negotiate their own commission splits** versus alternative models (predefined splits, manager-determined splits, and performance-based allocation). Key factors like collaboration, fairness, administrative effort, and conflict potential are considered for each approach. We then compare their impact on team dynamics, sales performance, and efficiency, and recommend an optimal approach.

## Salesperson-Negotiated Commission Splits

**Description:** In this model, the salespeople involved in a deal discuss and agree on how to divide the commission between themselves, rather than following a preset formula. They essentially negotiate what percentage each will take based on their view of their contributions.

- **Pros:**  
  - **Flexible & Potentially Fair:** The split can be tailored to each deal’s unique circumstances. Reps have the flexibility to adjust shares in proportion to who did more work on that specific sale, which *can* feel fairer than a one-size-fits-all split if both parties truly agree on each person’s contribution ([Sales Compensation: Should We Use Splits or Team Quotas?](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/sales-compensation-splits-or-team-quotas/#:~:text=Use%20split%20policies%20when%20there,if%20contribution%20was%20actually)). For example, if the default might be 50/50 but one rep actually did more of the heavy lifting, they could negotiate a 60/40 split to reflect that ([Sales Compensation: Should We Use Splits or Team Quotas?](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/sales-compensation-splits-or-team-quotas/#:~:text=Use%20split%20policies%20when%20there,if%20contribution%20was%20actually)).  
  - **Empowerment & Motivation:** Allowing reps to negotiate gives them a sense of ownership over the process. In cases where trust exists between team members, they can openly recognize each other’s efforts and reward accordingly. This might strengthen collaboration on future deals, as each person knows they have a say in the reward. It also can motivate reps to contribute more, knowing they could argue for a larger portion if they add exceptional value.  

- **Cons:**  
  - **Conflict Risk:** The need to negotiate can easily lead to disagreements and tension. If both reps feel they contributed more, negotiations may become contentious. Money disputes tend to **damage trust and create tension**, hurting team relationships and performance ([Preventing Commission Conflicts: A Guide to Resolving Disputes](https://www.kennect.io/post/preventing-commission-conflicts#:~:text=motivated%2C%20commission%20disputes%20are%20a,headache%20for%20everyone%20involved)). Without a clear rule, a stronger or more vocal personality might dominate the negotiation, leaving the other feeling short-changed. These conflicts can sour collaboration on the deal (and future deals) as reps focus on fighting for credit instead of closing the sale.  
  - **Inconsistent Fairness:** While flexible splits *could* be fair, they rely on the individuals’ integrity and negotiation skills. There’s a danger of unfair outcomes if one rep consistently pushes for a bigger share or if implicit biases play in. The final split might reflect negotiating ability more than actual contribution, which can breed resentment.  
  - **Administrative Complexity:** Every deal requires a fresh negotiation, which is time-consuming and operationally inefficient. The company must track and record a custom split each time, and possibly mediate disputes. Management often ends up getting involved anyway when reps can’t agree ([Sales Compensation: Should We Use Splits or Team Quotas?](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/sales-compensation-splits-or-team-quotas/#:~:text=60%2F40%20and%20the%20policy%20states,is%20the%20compensation%20review%20board)), meaning negotiations don’t fully remove the burden on leadership. In practice, companies that allow ad-hoc negotiated splits need a **documented process and dispute resolution policy** to handle conflicts ([Best practice guidance for using Sales Commission Splits](https://www.netcommissions.com/blog/bid/172969/Best-practice-guidance-for-using-Sales-Commission-Splits#:~:text=,total%20sales%20credit%20for%20a)), adding more overhead.  
  - **Impact on Team Dynamics:** The uncertainty around “who gets what” may discourage open collaboration. Team members might be hesitant to loop in a colleague on a deal if it means later haggling over commission. Instead of a culture where everyone works together freely, negotiation can create a guarded atmosphere until terms are settled. This can hurt overall sales performance if reps avoid teaming up on big opportunities to sidestep splitting the reward.

## Predefined Percentage Splits

**Description:** Here the company sets a predetermined formula for splitting commissions on joint deals. For example, a 50/50 split for two account executives working together, or specific percentage allocations based on role (e.g. salesperson gets 70%, sales engineer 30%). These rules are defined upfront and apply universally or to common scenarios.

- **Pros:**  
  - **Clarity & Simplicity:** Everyone knows the split arrangement in advance, which gives transparency and predictability. This removes any ambiguity about who gets what, so reps can focus on selling instead of worrying about negotiating their share. Administrative overhead is minimal – the split is applied automatically without case-by-case haggling.  
  - **Reduced Conflict:** Because the percentages are set by policy, there’s little to argue about. By taking negotiation off the table, the company **prevents internal conflicts** over credit allocation. For instance, one company avoided infighting by mandating an equal split on any co-sold deal ([My coworker gets half my commission and does nothing - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ff6c4o/my_coworker_gets_half_my_commission_and_does/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,a%20deal%20in%20our)). With a fair policy in place, reps can’t easily claim bias or feel cheated as long as they accept the system’s rules.  
  - **Encourages Teamwork:** Predefined splits can foster a collaborative culture since reps know that helping on a deal will still earn them a share. A well-designed split plan *“encourages cross-functional collaboration by rewarding team contributions rather than strictly individual efforts”* ([10 Sales Commission Structures to Motivate Reps (With Examples)](https://spotio.com/blog/how-to-determine-typical-commission-structures-for-sales-reps/#:~:text=,rather%20than%20strictly%20individual%20efforts)). Reps have less incentive to hoard opportunities because they won’t lose out entirely by involving others. In team-oriented sales environments, this model supports the idea that a win for one is a win for all.  

- **Cons:**  
  - **One-Size-Fits-All Fairness Issues:** A fixed split may not reflect the actual effort each rep put in on every deal. If one salesperson did significantly more (or performed the most critical tasks), an equal or preset division can feel unfair. High performers might resent always giving away, say, 50% to a colleague who contributed less. Over time, this could **demotivate top contributors** or encourage minimal effort from partners who know they’ll get paid regardless. In effect, there’s a risk of *free-riding* – someone relying on the other’s work to still earn their set share.  
  - **Limited Flexibility:** There’s little room to adjust for special cases. Maybe a deal was brought in entirely by Rep A, but company policy still requires giving Rep B a fixed portion because they were tagged on the account. Unless management makes an exception, the rigid split could seem like a bureaucracy that ignores individual contributions. This rigidity might also deter innovation in how teams sell; reps might stick to the letter of roles defined by the split formula and be unwilling to go above and beyond if the split won’t reward it.  
  - **Perceived Inequity in Complex Sales:** In enterprise SaaS deals, different people may play very different roles (e.g. one opens the door, another closes, another handles technical validation). A simple predefined split might not do justice to the complexity of contributions. If, for example, a sales engineer spends dozens of hours on a proof of concept but only gets 10% per policy, they might feel undervalued. Such feelings can hurt morale and willingness to fully engage next time.  

*Overall, predefined splits shine in operational efficiency and avoidance of quarrels, but they must be set thoughtfully to maintain perceived fairness.* Companies often choose an even split as a default in the spirit of fairness and ease, but should monitor if that causes any frustration among their teams.

## Management-Determined Splits

**Description:** In this model, a manager or sales leadership determines how the commission is split on a case-by-case basis. Instead of reps deciding or following a fixed rule, management assesses each person’s contribution to the deal and assigns split percentages accordingly (either before the deal is closed or after, during payout calculation).

- **Pros:**  
  - **Case-by-Case Fairness (if done well):** A attentive manager can weigh each team member’s role in the sale and allocate commission in proportion to their impact. This can yield a fairer outcome than a rigid formula. For example, management might decide one rep deserves a higher cut for sourcing and driving a large deal, while another who only assisted gets a smaller portion. In an ideal scenario, this ensures **people are rewarded in line with their actual contributions**, enhancing the sense of justice within the team.  
  - **Conflict Mediation:** Having a manager set the split can preempt or resolve disputes between reps. It removes the need for reps to hash it out directly if there’s disagreement. In essence, management serves as an arbiter – which can be healthier for team dynamics than colleagues battling each other. As best practice, *“each sales manager involved in a sales credit split should be aware of, collaborate and mutually approve of the split and the contribution percentage”* ([Best practice guidance for using Sales Commission Splits](https://www.netcommissions.com/blog/bid/172969/Best-practice-guidance-for-using-Sales-Commission-Splits#:~:text=,in%20situations%20where%20dispute%20resolution)). Management oversight means there’s an authority to enforce a decision and keep the process civil.  
  - **Strategic Alignment:** Leaders can use their discretion to align commission rewards with broader business goals or team norms. For instance, if collaboration is a core value, a manager might deliberately split more evenly even if one rep technically could claim more – to reinforce teamwork. Conversely, if the company wants to reward hunting new business, a manager might give extra credit to the rep who initiated the deal. This flexibility allows adjustments that a fixed policy might not cover, potentially improving sales performance by focusing reps on desired behaviors.  
  - **Transparent Rationale (when communicated):** A good manager will communicate why the split was decided a certain way, which can serve as feedback to reps. Reps learn what leadership values (e.g. “we awarded you X% because you led the demo and drove the negotiation”). Over time, this clarity can guide reps on how to maximize their contributions on team deals.

- **Cons:**  
  - **Perceptions of Bias or Favoritism:** If a rep doesn’t agree with the manager’s decision, they may feel it was biased. Any lack of transparency or consistency in how managers determine splits can lead to suspicions that favorites are getting a bigger slice. Unlike a formula, a manager’s decision might be seen as subjective – which can undermine trust if not handled carefully.  
  - **Reduced Autonomy:** Salespeople might feel disempowered when they have no say in their own commission division. This can impact morale, especially for senior reps who are used to more control over their deals. They might be less inclined to collaborate proactively if they fear a manager will later allocate most credit to someone else. In worst cases, reps could become more focused on “looking good” to the manager than genuinely teaming up (e.g. trying to claim visible tasks on a deal to impress the boss).  
  - **Management Overhead:** Involving management in every split decision adds workload and potential delays. It may not be scalable if many deals need review. Leaders’ time spent adjudicating splits is time not spent on coaching or strategy. If multiple managers are involved (e.g., cross-regional deal), coordination is needed so that all agree on the split, adding complexity. Clear guidelines must exist, or every negotiation may escalate to higher levels (some companies even convene compensation committees for tough split decisions ([Sales Compensation: Should We Use Splits or Team Quotas?](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/sales-compensation-splits-or-team-quotas/#:~:text=60%2F40%20and%20the%20policy%20states,is%20the%20compensation%20review%20board))). This bureaucratic element can slow down commission payouts and frustrate reps who just want closure.  
  - **Inconsistent Application:** Different managers might apply different criteria to splits, leading to inconsistent experiences across the sales force. One manager might always split 50/50 to be “fair,” while another carefully calibrates percentages – meaning reps on different teams effectively play by different rules. Such inconsistencies can cause confusion or a sense of injustice if discovered. It requires strong policy guidelines and training for managers to apply splits in a uniform, equitable way.  

In summary, manager-determined splits introduce a human judge to the process, which can increase fairness when done impartially, but also opens the door to subjectivity and added process. It’s crucial that management’s role in splits be governed by *clear policies and documentation* (who approves, how to handle disputes, etc.) ([Best practice guidance for using Sales Commission Splits](https://www.netcommissions.com/blog/bid/172969/Best-practice-guidance-for-using-Sales-Commission-Splits#:~:text=,total%20sales%20credit%20for%20a)) to maintain trust.

## Performance-Based Split Allocation

**Description:** A performance-based allocation means that the commission split is determined by measurable inputs or results each salesperson contributed. Rather than a fixed share or a subjective decision, the split is computed based on objective criteria – often tied to metrics or the portion of the deal “owned” by each person. For example, the split might be proportional to the revenue each rep brought in, the percentage of the sales process each handled, or specific performance indicators (like number of meetings arranged, product demos led, etc.). Essentially, it is a formula that **allocates the commission by contribution**.

- **Pros:**  
  - **Aligns Reward with Contribution:** This model explicitly ties pay to performance, which is inherently motivating. Each rep knows they will earn in direct relation to what they put into the deal, which is generally perceived as fair. In fact, many companies choose to define splits “based on ... deal contribution” ([Split commission calculator: Formulas & examples](https://www.remuner.com/blog/split-commission-calculator/#:~:text=Companies%20define%20commission%20splits%20based,types%20of%20commission%20structures%20include)) so that high contributors get commensurately higher rewards. For instance, if Rep A closed the deal and Rep B only sourced the lead, the formula might give A a larger percentage. Such alignment can drive reps to contribute fully and focus on the activities that matter most for closing sales.  
  - **Objective and Transparent (if metrics are clear):** When the split formula is based on quantifiable metrics, it leaves less room for argument. If everyone agrees on the performance criteria (say, value of contracts each rep signed, or quota attainment on that deal), the calculation is straightforward. This transparency can reduce feelings of bias – the numbers speak for themselves. It also simplifies dispute resolution: rather than arguing opinions, reps can look at the agreed data.  
  - **Encourages High Performance:** Knowing that every extra effort or achievement on a deal could increase one’s commission share incentivizes reps to go the extra mile. It can stimulate a healthy competition to contribute more – e.g. making more customer contacts, preparing better proposals – because those actions could be part of the contribution metrics. Over time, this can boost overall sales performance, as reps push harder to maximize their measured input.  
  - **Role-Based Fairness:** In cases where roles have different typical contributions (say a field sales rep vs. an inside sales support), a performance-based approach can ensure each role gets appropriate credit. For example, an agreed model might say the salesperson gets 1% of the deal per step they drive in the sales cycle, and a technical consultant gets a fixed cut for each demo or POC delivered. This way, each role’s performance is rewarded in a structured manner, giving even supporting players a clear path to earn commission based on their crucial assistance. This addresses the common pain point of overlooked contributors by explicitly valuing their work ([An Insider’s Guide to Handling Split Sales Compensation](https://www.kennect.io/post/split-sales-compensation#:~:text=This%20approach%20addresses%20critical%20pain,points%20like)).

- **Cons:**  
  - **Complexity in Setup:** Designing a fair formula for performance-based splits can be complex. You have to decide which metrics truly reflect contribution and how to weight them. Many aspects of enterprise sales are hard to quantify (e.g. relationship-building, influence on the buyer) and risk being undervalued in a strict formula. Getting the model right so that it feels fair and not overly complicated is a challenge – and if the formula is *too* complex, it can confuse reps. As a rule, **simplicity and clarity are vital** in any compensation plan; overly convoluted schemes can lead to confusion and backfire ([Best practice guidance for using Sales Commission Splits](https://www.netcommissions.com/blog/bid/172969/Best-practice-guidance-for-using-Sales-Commission-Splits#:~:text=Image%3A%20NetCommissions%20Sales%20Compensation%20Tool)).  
  - **Data and Tracking Requirements:** This approach demands reliable data tracking for the chosen performance metrics. If the split depends on, say, how many stages of the pipeline each rep completed, the CRM must accurately record those contributions. Not all organizations have the tools or discipline to capture this detail, leading to potential disputes about the inputs. The administrative burden increases – sales ops or finance needs to calculate each person’s share from the metrics, which may require advanced commission software or manual effort. Without automation, **split calculations via spreadsheets become a major headache** as deals and contributors multiply ([Best practice guidance for using Sales Commission Splits](https://www.netcommissions.com/blog/bid/172969/Best-practice-guidance-for-using-Sales-Commission-Splits#:~:text=,total%20sales%20credit%20for%20a)).  
  - **Potential for Gaming or Narrow Focus:** Tying pay to specific metrics might inadvertently encourage reps to game the system or focus only on measurable tasks. For example, if only the final contract value split is considered, two reps might both rush to be the one who gets the customer's signature, while neglecting cooperative selling. Or if the formula gives credit for initial lead sourcing and closing, a rep might avoid helping mid-deal (since those actions aren’t explicitly rewarded). In short, poorly chosen metrics can skew behavior and hurt true collaboration. The team could lose sight of the bigger picture (closing the deal efficiently) if each individual is too zeroed-in on maximizing their measured piece.  
  - **Mixed Team Dynamics:** Performance-based splits introduce a competitive element within the team. While competition can spur effort, it might also harm trust if not balanced by a spirit of unity. Team members could become reluctant to support each other beyond their assigned responsibilities, since doing “extra” might not increase their own metric. For instance, one rep might think, “Why should I help with your client presentation if it won’t boost my commission share?” This can create silos within what should be a collaborative sale. Managers need to ensure that the metrics chosen still encourage teamwork (perhaps by including a team performance component too) to avoid undermining cohesion.  

In summary, performance-based allocation can be very fair and motivating when contributions are measurable, but it requires a robust framework and careful management to avoid unintended consequences. It works best when the **performance metrics closely map to real value added** in the sales process, and when all team members buy into the system’s legitimacy.

## Comparing the Approaches

Each commission split approach influences team dynamics, sales outcomes, and operational efficiency differently. Below is a comparison across key dimensions:

- **Collaboration & Team Dynamics:** Predefined splits (and similar team-based credit models) generally promote harmony and teamwork by removing internal competition over the deal reward. When the split is known and equal, *everyone can “work toward a shared goal, leaving little room for lone-wolf tactics”* ([10 Sales Commission Structures to Motivate Reps (With Examples)](https://spotio.com/blog/how-to-determine-typical-commission-structures-for-sales-reps/#:~:text=When%20to%20use%20it%3A%20This,wolf)). In contrast, negotiated and performance-based splits can introduce **internal competition**. Negotiation might pit teammates against each other if they jostle for a bigger share, and performance-based schemes may make them hyper-aware of individual contributions. Management-determined splits fall in between – they can encourage collaboration if reps trust that their manager will fairly recognize their efforts, but if trust is lacking, reps might either compete for the manager’s favor or shy away from team selling. Notably, in scenarios where contributions are truly inseparable (a **“true team effort”**), some companies even choose to award 100% credit to all involved (often called a team or pooled quota) to *“eliminate contention among team members, who then combine their efforts toward a common goal”* ([Sales Compensation: Should We Use Splits or Team Quotas?](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/sales-compensation-splits-or-team-quotas/#:~:text=An%20alternative%20to%20splitting%20compensation,members%2C%20who%20generally%20combine%20their)). That extreme aside, the more an approach emphasizes *collective reward* (predefined or team-based) versus *individual claim* (negotiated or strictly performance-based), the more it tends to solidify teamwork. Too much emphasis on dividing the pie can erode the spirit of cooperation.

- **Fairness & Motivation:** Fairness can be seen in two ways – **distributive justice** (did everyone get what they deserved for their work?) and **procedural justice** (was the process for deciding clear and unbiased?). Predefined splits score high on procedural fairness (clear, same rules for all) but can falter on distributive fairness in specific cases. Performance-based and manager-decided splits aim to improve distributive fairness by aligning pay with actual contribution; when done right, this can be highly motivating for high performers and contributors. Salespeople are likely to feel most motivated when they trust that putting in more effort will noticeably increase their rewards – something performance-based models and flexible management decisions can deliver. However, if those processes are murky or inconsistently applied, motivation suffers. Negotiated splits rely on the individuals’ sense of fairness – they can be very fair if both parties are reasonable, but very unfair if one dominates. Importantly, any approach that results in frequent **perceived unfairness or unresolved disputes will hurt morale**. Reps disengage if they feel the system doesn’t reward them appropriately (in fact, a survey found many people have quit roles over pay disputes) ([Preventing Commission Conflicts: A Guide to Resolving Disputes](https://www.kennect.io/post/preventing-commission-conflicts#:~:text=A%20LinkedIn%20survey%20found%20that,Wow%2C%20now%20that%E2%80%99s%20something)). Thus, the best approach should strive to maximize genuine fairness (so reps feel valued for their work) while maintaining a transparent, trusted process.

- **Administrative Efficiency:** From an operational standpoint, **predefined splits are simplest** – minimal debate, easy calculation, and straightforward to automate. Each deal’s commission can be processed by applying the set percentages, keeping the comp admin workload low. **Negotiated splits** are the most labor-intensive: they require communication between reps, often oversight or approval (to document the agreed split), and possibly mediation by management if there’s disagreement. This can slow down closing out commissions and takes managers’ time. **Management-determined splits** centralize the work on managers and compensation admins to evaluate and assign each split, which doesn’t scale well if many deals need individual attention. It’s somewhat more efficient than reps fighting among themselves (since a single decision is made), but still a case-by-case process that’s harder to systematize. **Performance-based splits** fall in the middle – once the formula and tracking are set up, calculating each person’s share can be automated, especially with modern commission software. The heavy lifting is in the initial design of the system and ensuring data quality. If those are handled, ongoing admin can be relatively smooth, though one must always monitor for any needed adjustments or gaming of the system. We should note that any custom split scenario (negotiated, managerial, or performance-based) benefits from robust tools: many firms still rely on spreadsheets and email to administer splits, but experts advise **seeking opportunities to automate** to reduce errors and headaches in disputes ([Best practice guidance for using Sales Commission Splits](https://www.netcommissions.com/blog/bid/172969/Best-practice-guidance-for-using-Sales-Commission-Splits#:~:text=,total%20sales%20credit%20for%20a)). In short, the more standardized the approach, the more efficient – but potentially at a cost to flexibility.

- **Conflict Potential:** A key goal in choosing a commission split model is to minimize infighting and disputes, which can **“slow everything down”** in a sales org ([Preventing Commission Conflicts: A Guide to Resolving Disputes](https://www.kennect.io/post/preventing-commission-conflicts#:~:text=What%20Is%20a%20Sales%20Commission,Dispute)). Predefined splits (and especially team-based full credit approaches) have the lowest conflict potential because there’s nothing to argue – the rules are the rules, and everyone shares the win. Performance-based models can also be low-conflict if the metrics are clear-cut (e.g., split by revenue credit); in those cases, disputes are rare because results speak for themselves. However, if the performance criteria are unclear or data is disputed, conflict can arise around the numbers (“I actually drove more of this deal than the system shows!”). Negotiation inherently has high conflict potential – it’s basically inviting a potential argument every time unless the reps are perfectly aligned. Manager-decided splits can lead to conflicts being directed upward: reps might not fight each other openly, but they may both lobby the manager or complain after the decision, causing managerial conflict and HR headaches. A well-defined **escalation policy** is important in any flexible system – for example, Forrester Research suggests having sales leaders and a compensation review board as final arbiters if reps can’t agree on a fair split ([Sales Compensation: Should We Use Splits or Team Quotas?](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/sales-compensation-splits-or-team-quotas/#:~:text=60%2F40%20and%20the%20policy%20states,is%20the%20compensation%20review%20board)). The presence of a clear dispute resolution path can mitigate the damage of conflicts when they do occur. Overall, the risk of conflict is lowest when the split mechanism is straightforward and predetermined, and highest when subjective judgment calls are needed without clear guidelines.

## Recommended Approach

Considering the above, the optimal solution often lies in a **balanced approach** that combines the strengths of predefined rules with the flexibility to adjust for actual contributions. In practice, many organizations find success with a hybrid model: establish a **default split** as a starting point, but allow adjustments with oversight. For example, a policy might state that by default, two partnering reps split an enterprise deal 50/50, yet if one clearly contributed more, they can agree on a different ratio (such as 60/40) **by mutual consent** ([Sales Compensation: Should We Use Splits or Team Quotas?](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/sales-compensation-splits-or-team-quotas/#:~:text=Use%20split%20policies%20when%20there,if%20contribution%20was%20actually)). This encourages collaboration under the assumption of fairness, but gives leeway to recognize when someone went above and beyond. Crucially, the policy should include an escalation process: if the reps cannot agree, management steps in to finalize the split objectively ([Sales Compensation: Should We Use Splits or Team Quotas?](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/sales-compensation-splits-or-team-quotas/#:~:text=60%2F40%20and%20the%20policy%20states,is%20the%20compensation%20review%20board)). This way, the **negotiation** element is present to reward true merit, but bounded by predefined norms and managerial arbitration to prevent stalemates or unfair grabs.

Such a hybrid approach yields several benefits: it sets clear expectations (minimizing confusion and conflict) while preserving a sense of fairness and meritocracy. Reps know that usually “we’re in it together” – promoting unity – but also know that extraordinary effort won’t go unrecognized. It also streamlines administration: most deals follow the standard split (easy to process), and only special cases need discussion, which can be handled in a structured manner. 

If a hybrid model is not desired, **leaning toward structure is generally safer for team dynamics**. A predefined split model (or even a team-based credit model for tightly knit sales teams) avoids the pitfalls of internal disputes and is operationally efficient. It should be coupled with management vigilance to ensure it remains fair – e.g. periodically reviewing if the split percentages need adjusting, or if certain individuals are consistently under-rewarded. On the other hand, if measurable contributions are very clear in your sales process (for instance, in a **land-and-expand SaaS model** you might credit new customer acquisition vs. upsell differently), a performance-based split formula can work well. Just be sure to keep the formula simple and transparent ([Best practice guidance for using Sales Commission Splits](https://www.netcommissions.com/blog/bid/172969/Best-practice-guidance-for-using-Sales-Commission-Splits#:~:text=Image%3A%20NetCommissions%20Sales%20Compensation%20Tool)), and continue fostering a team spirit so that reps don’t become too internally competitive.

**In conclusion, the optimal commission split approach for joint deals is one that provides a stable framework to avoid conflict, but remains adaptable to actual performance.** A default or predefined split gives that stability and promotes trust, while a mechanism for performance-based adjustment (subject to agreement or manager approval) injects fairness and motivation. This combination tends to support healthy team dynamics – reps collaborate knowing there’s a fair safety net, and still push themselves knowing exceptional effort will be rewarded. It also strikes a balance between sales performance and operational efficiency: the team focuses on closing deals together, and the company handles commissions without excessive complexity. By implementing clear guidelines and a fair process, you ensure that commission splits reward collaboration and results, not internal politics – ultimately driving better outcomes for the sales team and the business.
