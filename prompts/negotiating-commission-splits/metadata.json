  "sceneDescription": "Three sales reps in crisp suits huddle around a small conference table, each clutching a slice of a large pie resting in the center. They eye one another’s portions warily, one poised to measure the slices with a ruler while another looks thoughtfully at a chart of neatly separated bars lying untouched beside them. The room is otherwise sparse, with only a simple clock ticking overhead and a single door cracked open, hinting at an outside manager’s presence. The tension in their expressions contrasts with the calm, orderly scene.",

The use of rulers to measure the pie slices cleverly symbolizes the precision and tension involved in the negotiation. The subtle humor and visual clarity fit well with The New Yorker's cartoon style."
