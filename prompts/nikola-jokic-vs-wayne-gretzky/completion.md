# Nikola Jokic vs. Wayne Gretzky: A Legendary Comparison

Both Nikola **Jokic** and Wayne **Gretzky** are generational talents who dominated their respective sports. They controlled games like conductors of an orchestra, each with a unique style that seemed impossible to replicate. Let's compare these two icons across five key areas.

## Dominance: Statistically Controlling the Game

([File:Nikola Jokic (51914124577).jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nikola_Jokic_(51914124577).jpg)) *Nikola Jokic's unassuming appearance belies his statistical domination on the court.* Jokic has established himself as one of the NBA's most dominant forces, especially in recent years. In the 2023 NBA Playoffs, he put up video-game numbers — averaging about **30.5 points, 13.5 rebounds and 9.5 assists** — and became the first player **ever** to lead all players in points, rebounds and assists in a single postseason ([Nuggets' Nikola Jokic sets yet another crazy playoff record](https://clutchpoints.com/nuggets-news-nikola-jokic-sets-crazy-playoff-record-nba-finals-win)). He notched **10 triple-doubles** during that title run, shattering the previous playoff record. Jokic's back-to-back MVP awards (2021 and 2022) and a Finals MVP in 2023 underscore how thoroughly he's been dominating his era. Even more impressively, he's done this as a **center** — a position traditionally not known for leading teams in assists. In fact, he's already recorded over 100 career triple-doubles, **the most ever by a center**, surpassing greats like Wilt Chamberlain. Jokic's combination of scoring efficiency, rebounding, and playmaking is so rare that it has "redefined the role of a modern big man" in today's game.

By comparison, **Wayne Gretzky's** dominance in hockey is often considered untouchable. Nicknamed "The Great One," Gretzky essentially rewrote the NHL record books. He retired holding **61 NHL records**, and even over two decades later he still holds 57 of them ([List of career achievements by Wayne Gretzky - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_career_achievements_by_Wayne_Gretzky)). He is the all-time leader in goals (894), assists (1,963), and points (2,857) — and it's not even close. In fact, Gretzky has more assists alone than any other player has total points in their career. He won the NHL scoring title an astounding **10 times** and was league MVP **9 times**, including eight consecutive seasons — feats unheard of in any sport. Gretzky's single-season records are equally mind-blowing: he once tallied **215 points in a season** (1985-86) with 163 assists ([Celebrating Wayne Gretzky: The Greatest of All Time in Hockey - American Sport History](https://americansportshistory.com/2024/12/30/celebrating-wayne-gretzky-the-greatest-of-all-time-in-hockey/)), and he's the **only player to break the 200-point mark — and he did it four times** ([Wayne Gretzky Records, Milestones, Broken Records and more - Sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/nhl/wayne-gretzky-records)). He also set the still-legendary mark of **50 goals in 39 games** to start the 1981-82 season, a pace considered virtually unbreakable. Whether measuring career totals or peak performances, Gretzky's dominance stands in a league of its own, much like Jokic's does in basketball's modern era.

## Unique Play Style: Unmatched and Unorthodox

Jokic and Gretzky achieved their dominance with styles that left coaches and opponents scratching their heads. **Nikola Jokic's** play style is delightfully unconventional. At first glance, Jokic is a **6'11" center** who doesn't wow you with athleticism — he's not a high-flyer or a sprinter. But his game is built on **skill, IQ, and finesse** rather than raw physicality. Jokic often plays like a "point guard in a center's body," orchestrating the Denver Nuggets' offense from the post and perimeter with astonishing passes ([How Nikola Jokic is Changing the Game of Basketball? - Metro League](https://www.metroleague.org/how-nikola-jokic-is-changing-the-game-of-basketball/)). He'll grab a rebound, lead the fast break, and throw a no-look, one-handed sling pass the length of the court — plays usually reserved for guards. His signature one-legged fadeaway, dubbed the **"Sombor Shuffle,"** is an off-balance shot that looks awkward but hits nothing but net. Jokic developed it to shoot over defenders when he had an ankle injury, and it's become a nearly unblockable move that epitomizes his crafty style ([MVP Nikola Jokic's 'Sombor Shuffle' is half step-back, half fadeaway ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUYTzXnHwtg)) ([Nuggets news: Nikola Jokic reveals true story behind the 'Sombor Shuffle'](https://clutchpoints.com/nuggets-news-nikola-jokic-reveals-true-story-behind-creation-of-special-move-sombor-shuffle)). Perhaps most impossible to copy is Jokic's **combination of vision and touch**. He'll make flick passes over his head or thread the ball through a crowd, things you just don't see other big men even attempt. As one analyst put it, "the way Nikola Jokic is playing the center position, it's unheard of" ([Nikola Jokic breaks down secret behind magical 'high IQ' passes](https://firstsportz.com/nikola-jokic-breaks-down-secret-behind-magical-high-iq-passes/)). He has essentially challenged every traditional notion of how a center should play, proving that even a self-described below-the-rim "fat kid" from Serbia can dominate through skill and smarts.

**Wayne Gretzky's** playing style was equally unique in the hockey world. In a sport known for speed and physicality, Gretzky dominated with **brain over brawn**. He was famously considered "too small, too slow and too wiry" by NHL standards when he started ([Anticipation – The Gretzky way – A Learning a Day](https://alearningaday.blog/2016/01/29/anticipation-the-gretzky-way/)). Instead of brute force, Gretzky relied on an almost mystical **hockey sense**. He had a knack for operating from unconventional spots on the ice — most notably **behind the opponent's net**, an area that came to be known as **"Gretzky's office."** He would set up camp back there, protected from defenders' checks, and patiently survey the chaos in front of the goal ([What Is Behind The Net In Hockey? Definition & Meaning | SportsLingo](https://www.sportslingo.com/sports-glossary/b/behind-the-net/)). From his "office," Gretzky could thread passes to teammates for easy goals or suddenly dart out for a wraparound shot. This style of using the area behind the net was virtually unheard of before him — nobody had ever seen a guy play from behind the net until Gretzky started doing it ([Wayne Gretzky was the first player in NHL to play behind the net, and the reason why makes him a genius](https://www.thehockeybeast.com/nhl/wayne-gretzky-was-the-first-player-in-nhl-to-play-behind-the-net-and-the-reason-why-makes-him-a-genius/)). His agility and **fluid movement** also set him apart. Gretzky wasn't the fastest straight-line skater, but he was incredibly elusive — he could stop, pivot, and change direction in a blink, slipping away from checks. Fans were often amazed by his no-look passes and the way he always seemed to find the open man. He brought a level of finesse and creativity that redefined the way hockey could be played, moving beyond conventional techniques. Young players marveled at how Gretzky played a style all his own — one that no one has truly been able to replicate since.

## Vision and Anticipation: Seeing the Game in Slow Motion

Perhaps the most striking trait both Jokic and Gretzky share is their otherworldly **vision** and anticipation. They don't just play the game; they see it unfold seconds ahead of everyone else, almost as if in slow motion.

For **Nikola Jokic**, this manifests in his jaw-dropping passing and game IQ. He often seems to know exactly what the defense will do and where his teammates will be, well before anyone else does. "There are no limits to Jokic's passing," one analysis noted, highlighting how he is routinely a step or two ahead of the defense. Even his own teammates sometimes struggle to keep up with how quickly he processes the game ([Why is Nikola Jokic considered the NBA's best player? Stats, accolades and more to know about Nuggets star | Sporting News](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nikola-jokic-best-nba-player-stats-accolades-nuggets/977cc980d525ca51bd554bfe)). Jokic will anticipate a cutter and deliver a ball to a spot before the player even realizes he's open. A perfect example is his ability to make cross-court passes over multiple defenders look easy. He'll whip the ball to the opposite corner the instant a defender turns his head, hitting shooters right in their sweet spot. Jokic himself has explained this simply: "I know my teammates better than opponents know them. If I can see my teammate in one moment, I know where he'll be in the next moment. I don't need to see him again." ([Nikola Jokic Quotes - BrainyQuote](https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/nikola-jokic-quotes)). This almost telepathic connection with the game allows Jokic to routinely pull off passes that nobody expects — except maybe Jokic himself. It's as if he has eyes all around his head, spotting openings that others wouldn't even imagine. His anticipation extends beyond passing; it also helps his scoring. He often fakes out defenders with pump-fakes and pivots, not because he's faster or jumps higher, but because he's predicted their reaction in advance. The result is that Jokic always appears to be one move ahead — playing chess while others play checkers — which is the hallmark of his genius on the court.

Wayne **Gretzky's** vision and anticipation were, if anything, even more legendary in the hockey realm. He famously said, "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been," perfectly encapsulating his almost psychic ability to read the game. Gretzky could seemingly sense where the puck and all the players would be a few seconds later, allowing him to be in the right place at the right time. On the ice, he had a **360-degree awareness** — he would make passes to teammates without even looking, because he already knew they were breaking into open ice. Opponents were baffled by how Gretzky kept finding gaps and players through tiny seams. Despite his unimpressive size and speed, he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time. His anticipation was so uncanny that people described it as a sixth sense. Gretzky modestly credited his father, Walter, for teaching him this skill. As a kid, Walter had young Wayne practice guessing where the puck would go — an anecdote Gretzky summarized with: "Some say I have a 'sixth sense'... Baloney. I've just learned to guess what's going to happen next. It's anticipation. It's not God-given, it's Wally-given." That training paid off immensely. On countless plays, Gretzky would intercept passes because he knew exactly where the last place a guy looks before he passes was, and he'd already be there. Watching Gretzky in his prime, it often felt like he had the game on a string — he knew every bounce, every angle. His field sense was so far beyond everyone else's that it often looked like he was orchestrating the entire rink. This supernatural vision made Gretzky not just a great scorer but the ultimate playmaker, elevating hockey IQ to an art form.

## Impact on Teammates: Making Everyone Around Them Better

Great players don't just put up stats; they elevate their teammates' performance, and both Jokic and Gretzky exemplify this trait. Each had a selfless streak in their game that made those around them shine.

On the basketball court, **Nikola Jokic** is the kind of star who delights in setting up others. The ball zips around when he's on the floor, and his unselfishness is contagious. In fact, the ball doesn't stick in Jokic's hands for long — he makes quick decisions to find the open man, bringing out the best in everyone around him. Role players thrive playing with Jokic because he'll reward them with easy baskets if they move and get open. A clear illustration of Jokic's impact on teammates is his partnership with Denver guard Jamal Murray. In Game 3 of the 2023 NBA Finals, Jokic and Murray achieved something never done before in NBA history: they **both recorded 30-point triple-doubles in the same game**, a feat no pair of teammates had ever accomplished ([NBA teammates with triple-doubles in same game: Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-teammates-triple-double-same-game-nikola-jokic-murray/pqut4osihxvi1dwbt1nszfbh)). Jokic's playmaking was a huge reason Murray was able to explode like that — time and again, Jokic's passes put Murray in position to score. "Cut, and he will find you," coaches tell anyone playing with Jokic. His teammates know that if they run the floor or curl around a screen, Jokic will see them and deliver the ball at exactly the right moment. This builds trust and confidence up and down the roster. Players like Aaron Gordon and Michael Porter Jr. have openly talked about how much easier the game is next to Jokic — they get wide-open looks and high-percentage shots thanks to his setups. It's no surprise that Denver's offense operates like a well-oiled machine with Jokic as the hub. His mindset is summed up by one of his own quotes: "A point makes you happy; an assist makes two people happy." That philosophy has turned the Nuggets into a joyful, sharing team where everyone prospers.

Wayne **Gretzky** had a similar uplifting effect on his teammates in hockey. He was not only a prolific scorer but also an ultimate team player who loved to pass the puck. During his Edmonton Oilers days in the 1980s, Gretzky centered a line that made stars out of those who played with him. Wingers like **Jari Kurri** and **Glenn Anderson** became household names partly because Gretzky was feeding them perfect passes night after night. Kurri, for example, scored 71 goals in one season playing on Gretzky's wing — many of them courtesy of Gretzky's playmaking. Gretzky quickly developed a reputation as "a player who made his teammates better — a true mark of a leader." He would as happily rack up assists as he would goals, always looking to make the right play for the team. His unselfish style and pinpoint setups meant that even average players could suddenly find themselves scoring heaps of points alongside him. Gretzky's career assist total (1,963) is a testament to this generosity — it demonstrates that he prioritized team success over personal accolades. Beyond the numbers, Gretzky's presence lifted his team's confidence. His teammates have recalled how having Gretzky on the ice made them believe anything was possible, because he would find a way to create a scoring chance out of thin air. He also had a calming leadership that settled the team during high-pressure moments, often encouraging others and sharing the limelight. The Oilers won four Stanley Cups with Gretzky, and while they had other great players, many would say Gretzky's ability to raise everyone's level was the special sauce that turned a good team into a dynasty. Even later in his career with the Los Angeles Kings, he took a young, mediocre team and led them all the way to the Stanley Cup Final in 1993, showing how he could elevate those around him. In short, both Gretzky and Jokic epitomize the idea that a true superstar makes everyone on the team better.

## Influence on the Game: A Lasting Legacy

Beyond their personal achievements and awards, both Jokic and Gretzky have had a profound long-term influence on how their sports are played and perceived.

**Nikola Jokic's** influence on basketball is already being felt, even as he continues his career. He has essentially reinvented the center position in the modern era. Traditionally, NBA centers were big men who stayed near the hoop to block shots and score in the paint. Jokic has blown up that old model — he's proven that a center can be the primary playmaker and run the offense like a point guard. His success has popularized the concept of the "**point center**." More teams are now looking for big men with versatile skill sets who can shoot, dribble, and especially pass. We've seen players like Joel Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo expand their playmaking, and teams draft tall prospects with an eye toward finding "the next Jokic." As one write-up noted, "With every passing possession, game, and achievement for Denver's center, he is rewriting how the center position is played" ([Ranking The Top 100 NBA Players For The 2023-24 Season: 10-1](https://fadeawayworld.net/ranking-the-top-100-nba-players-for-the-2023-24-season-10-1)). His influence is also evident in strategy: coaches have to devise new ways to defend a player who can score from anywhere and also pick you apart with passes. Double-teaming him often backfires because of his vision, which has led teams to rethink defensive schemes against elite playmaking big men. Moreover, Jokic's rise from the **41st pick in the draft** to NBA superstardom is influencing scouting and player development. He was famously drafted during a Taco Bell commercial — a humble second-round pick — yet he blossomed into a two-time MVP. That story has inspired teams to place more value on basketball IQ and skill, not just athletic wow-factor, when evaluating talent. Internationally, Jokic's stardom (he's from Serbia) continues the globalization of the NBA game, inspiring young players in Europe that they too can become the best in the world. In summary, Jokic is changing perceptions of what a center can be: thanks to him, the NBA is embracing a more positionless, team-oriented style, where any player on the floor — even a lumbering 7-footer — might be the one making the key pass or play. We can already see his fingerprints on the next generation of bigs who are developing all-around skills.

The long-term influence of **Wayne Gretzky** on hockey is arguably greater than that of any single player in any sport. Gretzky didn't just break records; he changed the trajectory of the hockey world. On the ice, his style of play influenced countless young players and even professional peers. Generations of NHL stars, from Mario Lemieux to Sidney Crosby, grew up studying Gretzky's moves, trying to emulate his vision and creativity. Many players have adopted elements of Gretzky's game — for instance, setting up plays from behind the net and valuing playmaking as much as goal-scoring. His emphasis on finesse and smarts helped shift hockey a bit away from just brute force, encouraging a more wide-open, offensive style in the late '80s and beyond. But Gretzky's influence goes well beyond X's and O's — he literally made the sport of hockey more popular, especially in the United States. When he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988, it was like an earthquake for the NHL. Suddenly, hockey had a superstar in Hollywood, and it "immediately made hockey cool in Southern California" ([Gretzky trade to Kings left long-lasting impact on NHL, sport | NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/news/wayne-gretzky-trade-to-kings-left-long-lasting-impact-on-nhl-sport-299703576)). In the years after, the NHL expanded rapidly into new markets: teams popped up in San Jose, Tampa Bay, Anaheim, Florida, and more ([The Wayne Gretzky Trade: The Deal That Changed The NHL Forever](https://www.sports-king.com/wayne-gretzky-trade-3240/)) — a wave directly attributed to the "Gretzky effect." Youth hockey registrations soared in non-traditional markets like California; within a few years, tens of thousands of kids in the American southwest were lacing up skates. It's no exaggeration to say Gretzky is a big reason hockey became a truly nationwide (and even international) game rather than one centered in Canada and the northern US. He has been an ambassador for the sport, attracting new fans wherever he went. Even NHL rules were tweaked due to Gretzky's impact — for example, in the 1980s the league adjusted how coincidental penalties were handled largely because Gretzky's Oilers were too lethal in 4-on-4 situations ([Kings 5, Oilers 4 OT - UPI Archives](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/10/15/Kings-5-Oilers-4-OT/1284624427200/)). Moreover, Gretzky's legacy of sportsmanship and leadership set a standard; he inspired a culture of professionalism and community service among hockey players, showing that superstars could be humble and team-oriented. In sum, Wayne Gretzky's career changed hockey long-term in multiple ways: he expanded the geography of the game, influenced its style of play, and inspired future generations to dream bigger. His footprint remains enormous, as the sport today still basks in the glow of the trails he blazed.

In comparing Nikola Jokic and Wayne Gretzky, we see two athletes in different sports who share some striking similarities. Both dominated their leagues statistically and led their teams to championships. Both played with a unique flair that left spectators and fellow players in awe, and both had a vision of the game that seemed almost supernatural. Perhaps most importantly, both The Joker and The Great One made everyone around them better and left an indelible mark on their sports. One is still adding to his legacy each night in the NBA, and the other's legend grows with each passing year in NHL history. What's clear is that each will be remembered not just for their numbers, but for the way they changed the game — turning their exceptional talents into a lasting influence on basketball and hockey alike.
