  "prompt": "Is Nikola Jokic the Wayne Gretzky of the NBA? Watching Jokic has made me realize that I never understood basketball well enough, and makes me wonder what else could be solved a different way than we all believe. Was Gretzky that way too? How yes and how no? I didn't watch too much of him at the time.",

  "sceneDescription": "In a split arena, half basketball court and half hockey rink, Jokic dribbles with languid grace on his side while Gretzky glides in a poised stance on the ice. They share a knowing look, each serenely orchestrating teammates and opponents who seem drawn into a single fluid dance. Overhead, one scoreboard spans both halves, overwhelmed by cascading statistics. The contrasting lines of the court and rink create a neat divide, yet the two athletes exude a similar quiet mastery that dissolves the boundary between their sports.",
