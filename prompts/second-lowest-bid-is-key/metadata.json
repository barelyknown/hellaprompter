  "sceneDescription": "A row of solemn businesspeople in dark suits stands before a government official seated at a long desk. Each person clutches a sealed envelope. One figure at the front, wearing a restrained grin, receives a handshake and a contract from the official. Another figure, envelope in hand, stands just behind, body language revealing a deflated realization. The official uses a tiny ruler to compare the edges of the two envelopes. The scene highlights the razor-thin margin between winning and losing in the bidding process.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "2. This illustration captures the essence of the article with the official using a ruler to highlight the fine margins in the bidding process. The expressions of the businesspeople reflect the competitive nature of the scene, aligning well with New Yorker humor and style.",

  "pullQuotes": [
    "\"In a low-bid auction, you don’t need to dramatically underbid everyone else; you just need to be a hair lower.\"",
    "\"If you bid much lower than necessary, you’ll still win, but you sacrifice profit that you could have kept.\"",
    "\"The difference between your winning bid and the second-lowest bid is often called “money left on the table.”\"",
    "\"That $90,000 is profit left on the table by bidding $1,000,000 when they only needed to bid slightly under $1,100,000.\"",
    "\"If you could magically know your closest competitor’s price in advance, you’d set your bid a hair below it and win with maximum profit.\""
