  "sceneDescription": "A row of solemn businesspeople in dark suits stands before a government official seated at a long desk. Each person clutches a sealed envelope. One figure at the front, wearing a restrained grin, receives a handshake and a contract from the official. Another figure, envelope in hand, stands just behind, body language revealing a deflated realization. The official uses a tiny ruler to compare the edges of the two envelopes. The scene highlights the razor-thin margin between winning and losing in the bidding process.",
