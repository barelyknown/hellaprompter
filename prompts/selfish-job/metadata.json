  "sceneDescription": "In a stark corporate boardroom, a group of identical-suited employees meticulously adjusts a large evolutionary chart pinned to the wall. The simple drawings progress from a single-celled creature up to a modern worker in a suit, whose figure is nearly engulfed by a tangled nest of policy binders. While one person carefully straightens the final image, the others hover around it, quietly ensuring their own place in the elaborate structure remains secure. The overall mood is calm, yet each figure appears subtly intent on self-preservation.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "2. This illustration effectively captures the evolutionary analogy with clarity and humor. The progression from early creatures to the modern suited worker is depicted with a clear visual flow. The inclusion of binders as the final stage cleverly symbolizes the entanglement of bureaucratic processes, aligning well with the article's theme. The style is characteristic of The New Yorker, emphasizing the humor in self-preservation within corporate structures."
