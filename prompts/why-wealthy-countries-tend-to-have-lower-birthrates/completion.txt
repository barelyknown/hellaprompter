# Why Wealthier Countries Tend to Have Lower Birthrates

## Introduction  
Wealthier countries around the world consistently show **much lower birthrates** (fertility rates) compared to poorer countries. This inverse relationship between prosperity and childbearing is so common that demographers refer to it as the **“demographic–economic paradox.”** In general, as national income and education levels rise, the average number of children born per woman falls ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=Income%20and%20fertility%20%20is,who)). For example, Japan’s per capita GDP is high and its fertility rate is only about *1.2* children per woman, whereas Ethiopia’s per capita GDP is much lower and its fertility rate is around *6.1* ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=Generally%20a%20developed%20country%20has,8)). As one Indian minister put it at a 1974 UN conference, **“Development is the best contraceptive.”** ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=are%20born%20in%20any%20developed,7)) In other words, economic and social development naturally leads to smaller families.

 ([File:Total Fertility Rate Map by Country.svg - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Total_Fertility_Rate_Map_by_Country.svg)) *Figure: Global map of total fertility rates by country (2024). The wealthiest regions – North America, Europe, East Asia, and Australia (shown in blue tones) – have low birthrates (often below 2 children per woman), whereas poorer regions like most of Africa (brown tones) have high birthrates (above 4). This illustrates the broad inverse correlation between national income and fertility rates.* 

The trend of **lower birthrates in wealthier societies** has deep historical roots and continues in recent patterns across all regions. Below, we analyze the long-term **historical transition** that led to today’s low fertility in developed nations, and then break down the **key factors** – economic, sociological, cultural, and biological – that explain why affluence often brings fewer babies. We also examine **notable exceptions** to the rule and why they occur, considering perspectives from around the globe.

## Historical Trends: The Demographic Transition  
Over the past two centuries, countries have gone through a remarkable **demographic transition** as they develop. Historically, in pre-industrial societies, both birthrates and death rates were very high (families had many children, but many died young), resulting in slow population growth. With modernization, **death rates fall first** – improvements in nutrition, sanitation, and medicine save lives, especially reducing infant and child mortality. Birthrates initially remain high in this stage, causing a burst of population growth. **Later, birthrates begin to decline** as society adapts to the new conditions ([Demographic transition: Why is rapid population growth a temporary phenomenon? - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition#:~:text=,have%20fewer%20children%20than%20before)). 

Several forces drive this fertility decline in the transition from a poor agrarian society to a wealthy industrial one: 

- **Lower Child Mortality:** When most children survive to adulthood (thanks to better health), parents no longer need to have many offspring to ensure a few survive. Historically, as **child mortality dropped, parents adjusted by having fewer children** ([Demographic transition: Why is rapid population growth a temporary phenomenon? - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition#:~:text=rates%20%2C%20we%20discuss%20in,shaped%3B%20as%20the)). For example, once couples realized that nearly all their children would live, they chose to limit family size.  
- **Economic Changes:** Industrialization and urbanization change the value of children. In agrarian economies, **children are assets** – they contribute labor on farms and care for parents in old age. In industrial urban economies, **children become costlier** to raise and less economically useful to the household ([Demographic transition: Why is rapid population growth a temporary phenomenon? - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition#:~:text=rates%20%2C%20we%20discuss%20in,have%20fewer%20children%20than%20before)). This reduces the incentive for large families as countries get richer.  
- **Women’s Empowerment:** As development progresses, women gain education and opportunities outside the home. With more women in school and the workforce, **marriage and childbearing are often delayed**, and families end up smaller on average ([Demographic transition: Why is rapid population growth a temporary phenomenon? - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition#:~:text=rates%20%2C%20we%20discuss%20in,have%20fewer%20children%20than%20before)). When women have more say in their lives and access to careers, they tend to choose fewer children.  

This pattern – high births dropping to low births as societies become wealthier and more urban – has repeated across **all regions** in the last 150 years. Europe and North America underwent this transition in the 19th and 20th centuries, and **Latin America and Asia saw dramatic fertility declines** in the late 20th century even before becoming fully rich ([

For instance, in **Bangladesh**, the total fertility rate fell from about *6.9* in 1970 to *2.0* in 2019 – an extraordinary drop achieved through better child survival, **family planning access**, urbanization, and women’s education, despite Bangladesh still being a lower-income country ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8409340/#:~:text=1970s%2C%20it%20fell%20at%20a,2)). Virtually every society that has achieved a degree of development has eventually seen birthrates fall. This has occurred **largely independent of culture or religion**, following the universal pattern of mortality decline followed by fertility decline ([Demographic transition: Why is rapid population growth a temporary phenomenon? - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition#:~:text=This%20decline%20in%20the%20death,or%20religion%20of%20the%20population)). Today, **low birthrates are the norm in most highly developed nations**, and many are at or below the “replacement” level of ~2.1 children per woman needed to keep a population stable ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=conditions%20for%20their%20life%20and,9)) ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=It%20is%20hypothesized%20that%20the,11)).

With that historical context, we can explore **why wealth and development lead to lower birthrates**. The causes are multi-faceted, spanning economics, social changes, cultural shifts, and even biological factors. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of these explanations.

## Economic Factors (Cost and Benefits of Children)  
One major reason richer countries have lower birthrates is that the **economics of childbearing change** with development. In wealthy societies, raising children is no longer an economic necessity for families – in fact, it becomes an **economic cost**. Key economic factors include:

- **Cost of Raising Children:** In developed countries, children are **expensive to raise**, requiring many years of education, healthcare, housing, and material support. Rather than contributing labor (as on a family farm), a child in a modern city is an economic *dependent* for a long time. As incomes rise, parents often choose to invest more resources in **each child’s “quality”** – such as better education and extracurriculars – rather than have a larger quantity of children ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=childbirth%20and%20parenting%20rather%20than,12)) ([
            Declining birth rate in Developed Countries: A radical policy re-think is required - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4255510/#:~:text=countries%20tend%20to%20have%20a,women%20have%20children%20late%20in)). This “quality over quantity” trade-off means affluent parents frequently stop at one or two children so they can give them the best opportunities ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=,12)). Children can even be seen as **financial “drains”** on the household budget in rich countries, due to the high costs of schooling, childcare, housing, and general upbringing ([
            Declining birth rate in Developed Countries: A radical policy re-think is required - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4255510/#:~:text=countries%20tend%20to%20have%20a,women%20have%20children%20late%20in)). These costs discourage large families.  

- **Opportunity Cost of Parents’ Time:** People with higher income or education face a greater **opportunity cost** when they take time away from careers to raise children. For both men and women – but especially for women – having a child can mean interrupting one’s career, losing promotions or earnings, or foregoing other opportunities. In wealthy countries where wages are high, this lost income and career growth can be substantial. Thus, **professionals may limit their family size** in order to maintain their careers ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=,12)). As the Wikipedia summary notes, *“people earning more have a higher opportunity cost if they focus on childbirth and parenting rather than their career.”* ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=,12)) The higher someone’s salary, the more “costly” in missed income a career break for child-rearing becomes – leading many high-income individuals or couples to delay childbearing or opt for fewer kids.

- **Female Economic Independence:** In developed economies, women can usually **work and earn independently**, reducing the economic “need” to marry early or have children for financial security. Women who can support themselves have less incentive to become or stay married **solely for economic reasons**, and they may choose to have fewer or no children ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=,11)). This factor is partly economic and partly social: when women have their own earning power, childbearing becomes more of a choice than a necessity. Societies with **dual-income households** also often delay or limit children, because coordinating careers and family life can be challenging and costly (for example, paying for childcare while both parents work). 

- **Old-Age Security and Pensions:** In poor agrarian societies, parents rely on having many children as a form of **old-age security** – adult children will support their aging parents. In wealthy nations, however, there are usually **pension systems and social safety nets**. The elderly get financial support from government or investments, not just from their kids. This removes a big incentive for having a large number of children. Because parents in rich countries trust that they will have retirement income and healthcare, they don’t feel the same pressure to “produce” caretakers for old age. Economists note that the introduction of public **pensions correlates with fertility decline**, as parents no longer need extra children for security in later life. 

- **Urbanization and Housing Costs:** Wealthier countries are highly urbanized. In cities, living space is limited and housing is expensive, making large families more difficult. Many urban dwellers live in apartments or small houses not suited for many kids. Additionally, in urban settings children cannot easily contribute economically (unlike farm work), and they require supervision and education. The **shift from rural farm life to urban city life** thus lowers fertility. Urban families tend to be smaller worldwide, and rich countries are predominantly urban. Simply put, it is *costlier and less practical to raise many children in a modern city* environment.

Together, these economic factors mean that in affluent societies **children are no longer an economic asset – they are an investment and a consumer good** that parents must financially support. As a result, many couples in wealthy countries calculate that they **“can’t afford” more than one or two children**, given the lifestyle they desire for themselves and their kids. This economic calculus strongly contributes to lower birthrates with rising wealth ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4255510/#:~:text=countries%20tend%20to%20have%20a,women%20have%20children%20late%20in)).

## Sociological Factors (Education, Gender Roles, and Lifestyle)  
Beyond pure economics, a range of **social changes** that come with development lead to smaller families. These sociological factors involve how people choose to live, work, and form families in modern affluent societies:

- **Education and Career (Especially for Women):** One of the most consistent predictors of lower fertility is **female education**. As girls and young women attain higher education levels, they tend to marry later and have fewer children. In wealthier countries, a much larger proportion of women complete secondary and tertiary education, which often means entering childbearing years later. Educated women also have **greater knowledge of family planning** and more autonomy in reproductive decisions. The rise in women’s **labor force participation** is closely tied to lower birthrates ([Why Is the U.S. Birth Rate Declining? | PRB](https://www.prb.org/resources/why-is-the-u-s-birth-rate-declining/#:~:text=Between%202007%20and%202020%2C%20the,6)) ([
            Declining birth rate in Developed Countries: A radical policy re-think is required - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4255510/#:~:text=is%20easily%20accessible%20and%20children,in%20a%20demographic%20economic%20paradox)). When most women are pursuing careers, it’s common to postpone having children until the late 20s or 30s, which naturally limits the number of children possible. For instance, in the United States the dramatic drop in birthrates since the mid-2000s is partly attributed to women delaying marriage/childbearing and achieving higher education and employment ([Why Is the U.S. Birth Rate Declining? | PRB](https://www.prb.org/resources/why-is-the-u-s-birth-rate-declining/#:~:text=Between%202007%20and%202020%2C%20the,6)). In short, **educated, working women tend to have smaller families**, a pattern seen across virtually all developed societies.

- **Delayed Marriage and Childbearing:** Wealthier countries have seen a clear trend toward **marrying later or not at all**, and likewise delaying first births. In low-income traditional societies, marriage and parenthood often occur soon after puberty. In affluent societies, young adults often spend their 20s focusing on education, career, or personal goals. The average age of first marriage and first childbirth has risen significantly in the developed world (often into the 30s). This delay means a **shorter reproductive window** and fewer years in which a couple can have children, resulting in lower total fertility. Many people in rich countries also spend more years single or cohabiting without children. By the time they feel “ready” for kids (perhaps after achieving some financial stability or career milestone), they may only have time or energy for one child before fertility naturally declines. In the US, for example, birthrates among women in their early 20s have plummeted since the 1960s, while births to women in their 30s have risen – indicating postponement ([Why Is the U.S. Birth Rate Declining? | PRB](https://www.prb.org/resources/why-is-the-u-s-birth-rate-declining/#:~:text=During%20the%201960s%20and%201970s%2C,9)). **Later childbearing = fewer children**, simply due to biology and life stage.

- **Urban Lifestyles and Individualism:** Social life in wealthy nations often emphasizes **individual fulfillment and personal freedom**. In contrast to more traditional societies where family and child-rearing are central to one’s identity, modern urban culture offers many alternative life paths. Young adults in high-income countries may prioritize experiences like travel, hobbies, career advancement, or relationships *before* settling down to have kids. The **freedom to live independently** (without social pressure to marry young) and the attractions of urban life can lead many to remain childfree or with just one child. Additionally, **urban social networks** can normalize smaller families – if your peers are mostly having one child or none, that feels like the acceptable norm. The result is a cultural environment in cities (where most wealthy-country residents live) that is not strongly oriented toward large families.

- **Changing Family Structure:** Development often accompanies a shift from extended family living to **nuclear families** or even solo living. In poorer rural settings, extended families sharing a household can help with child-rearing (grandparents, aunts, etc. helping to care for many kids). In rich societies, households are typically just the parents and children, or single parents, with limited help. This makes raising multiple children more challenging socially. The rise of **dual-income couples** (both parents working) also makes large families difficult to manage without outside support. Furthermore, modern societies have higher rates of divorce and people living alone, which generally leads to fewer children per adult. All these social arrangements – **smaller households, both parents working, weaker extended family support** – tend to push fertility lower in wealthier contexts.

- **Access to Family Planning:** It’s worth noting that as societies modernize, **access to contraception and reproductive health services improves**, which is a social and public health factor enabling people to choose smaller families. In developed countries, birth control is readily available and widely used, making it easier to prevent unplanned pregnancies. This is a crucial difference – in poor countries, even if a couple *wanted* to limit births, they might lack the means to do so. Wealth and development usually bring robust **family planning programs**, which empower people (especially women) to implement their preference for fewer children. The availability of contraception is often cited as a key reason fertility falls with development ([
            Declining birth rate in Developed Countries: A radical policy re-think is required - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4255510/#:~:text=countries%2C%20fertility%20rates%20are%20higher,women%20have%20children%20late%20in)). For example, in developing countries that experienced fertility decline, increased contraceptive use was a major factor (Bangladesh’s contraceptive prevalence rose from ~8% in the 1970s to ~60% by the 2000s, facilitating its drop in births ([CASE 13: Reducing fertility in Bangladesh](https://www.cgdev.org/page/case-13-reducing-fertility-bangladesh#:~:text=CASE%2013%3A%20Reducing%20fertility%20in,fertility%20decreased%20from%20an))). In wealthy nations, most couples can reliably control when and if they have kids – a fundamental shift from earlier eras.

In summary, **education, urbanization, and evolving social roles** reshape family life in wealthy countries. Women’s empowerment and career focus, later marriage, smaller household units, and access to birth control collectively create a social environment where low fertility is the norm. These sociological shifts are intimately connected with economic development, and they help explain why richer populations voluntarily choose to have fewer children.

## Cultural Factors (Values and Norms About Family)  
Culture plays an important role in fertility decisions, and affluent societies often undergo **cultural changes** that favor lower birthrates. Some key cultural and attitudinal factors are:

- **Changing Values and Priorities:** As countries become richer and more educated, there is frequently a move toward more **secular, individualistic values**. Traditional cultural imperatives like “have as many children as possible” or religious injunctions to “be fruitful and multiply” tend to weaken. Instead, personal fulfillment, career achievement, and material comfort gain prominence as life goals. In many wealthy societies, **self-actualization** and experiences are valued over family size. Having children is seen as one of many possible paths in life, not an obligatory one. This cultural shift results in more people **choosing smaller families** or consciously deciding to remain childfree for personal or environmental reasons. For example, concerns about overpopulation or climate change lead some in affluent countries to forgo having kids – a mindset that is largely cultural.

- **Norms About Ideal Family Size:** Culture strongly influences what people consider the “ideal” number of children. In high-fertility cultures (often poorer countries), it’s common to aspire to 4, 5, or more children, and large families confer social status. In low-fertility cultures (wealthier countries), the ideal may be only 2 or even 1 child, and having a very large family can be seen as unusual. Over time, developed societies have adjusted to seeing **small families as normal**. There is also less social pressure to have a child at all – being single or childless is widely accepted in a way that it might not be in more traditional settings. The result is that the **social norm** in wealthy nations does not push people to have “as many kids as possible”; instead, having one or two (or none) is completely acceptable and often expected. This cultural acceptance reinforces low birthrates across generations.

- **Role of Religion and Secularization:** Many poorer societies with high birthrates also have cultures that strongly encourage childbearing (through religious or ethnic traditions). In contrast, many wealthier societies have undergone **secularization** – a decline in religious influence – which often correlates with lower fertility. For instance, countries in secular Europe or East Asia have some of the lowest birthrates. That said, the effect of religion can cut both ways: within a rich country, more religious subgroups often have more children than secular ones. But overall, as a nation modernizes, religious adherence and the pronatal teachings of religion may diminish, contributing to smaller family norms. People in secular, rich societies may derive their sense of meaning from sources other than raising children (career, art, travel, etc.), a cultural orientation that tends to limit fertility.

- **“Second Demographic Transition” – Lifestyle Choices:** Demographers sometimes describe a *second demographic transition* in ultra-wealthy societies, characterized by **post-materialist lifestyle choices**. This includes higher rates of cohabitation without marriage, having children outside of marriage, prioritizing gender equality in relationships, and an emphasis on personal autonomy. These cultural shifts can lead to delayed or reduced childbearing. For example, if young adults live together without the commitment of marriage, they might be slower to start a family. If couples prioritize egalitarian partnerships, they might wait until both partners feel their careers and lives are ready for interruption by kids – which might never happen for more than one child. Societies like Sweden or the Netherlands have experienced such cultural shifts and have low but slightly more stable fertility partly because they adapted (e.g., normalizing out-of-wedlock births with strong social support). Meanwhile, places like *South Korea or Japan* have very low fertility in part because of a cultural clash – modern women have new expectations, but workplace and gender norms have not fully adjusted, so many women opt out of motherhood altogether. In short, the complex of cultural attitudes about **family, gender, and self** that emerges in advanced economies often isn’t conducive to high birthrates.

- **Diffusion of Ideas:** Cultural exchange and media also spread low-fertility norms. Today, even lower-income regions are exposed to images of small Western families on TV and social media. This can accelerate cultural change toward lower desired fertility even *before* a country becomes rich. In fact, modern developing countries are reducing birthrates faster than European countries did at similar income levels, precisely because **globalized culture and ideas** (plus technology like TV, internet) diffuse new family norms ([More Money, More Babies: What’s the Relationship Between Income & Fertility? | Institute for Family Studies](https://ifstudies.org/blog/more-money-more-babies-whats-the-relationship-between-income-fertility#:~:text=industrialization,actually%C2%A0tend%20to%20have%20more%20children)). For example, many African nations have fertility rates lower than Europe’s were when at the same stage of income, partly due to adopting norms of smaller families from abroad ([More Money, More Babies: What’s the Relationship Between Income & Fertility? | Institute for Family Studies](https://ifstudies.org/blog/more-money-more-babies-whats-the-relationship-between-income-fertility#:~:text=industrialization,actually%C2%A0tend%20to%20have%20more%20children)). Thus, culture is not static – as wealth grows, cultural norms adapt, and in an interconnected world even poorer societies are culturally shifting toward lower fertility ideals.

It’s important to note that cultural factors can also explain **exceptions** (more on exceptions later). Some wealthy communities maintain higher birthrates because their culture emphasizes childbearing (for instance, strongly religious groups or cultures valuing large families). Overall, though, the **broad cultural trajectory of development is toward fewer children**, as people in wealthy societies redefine what a “good life” entails and often place less central importance on having many offspring.

## Biological and Health Factors  
While economic, social, and cultural explanations account for much of the decline in birthrates, there are also **biological and health-related factors** tied to wealth and modernization that influence fertility:

- **Improved Child Survival and Biology of Reproduction:** As mentioned earlier, one biological feedback of development is that **almost all children survive**, which inherently leads parents to have fewer pregnancies. In high-mortality environments, humans evolved a strategy of having many offspring (knowing some won’t survive). In low-mortality modern environments, that **biological imperative relaxes** – parents intuitively don’t need to “overshoot” by having extra kids. Thus, longer healthy lives and low infant mortality, hallmarks of wealthy nations, biologically support the decision to have fewer children ([Demographic transition: Why is rapid population growth a temporary phenomenon? - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition#:~:text=rates%20%2C%20we%20discuss%20in,have%20fewer%20children%20than%20before)). Moreover, with long life expectancy, parents can spread births out or delay them without fear of not living to raise children, which can reduce urgency to have kids early and often.

- **Later Maternal Age and Fecundity:** Wealthier societies encourage later childbearing, but **human fertility is age-limited**, especially for women. By postponing first births into the 30s, many women simply cannot have as many children as they could if they started at age 20. **Biologically, fertility declines with age** (women’s egg quantity/quality drops and risks rise). Even with good health, a woman who has her first child at 35 might only manage one more before menopause. In aggregate, this **raises infertility rates and lowers total births** in wealthy countries where marrying/giving birth late is common. In contrast, in countries where women have children at ages 18–24, there is more time to have 3, 4, or more kids. Thus, the **timing of reproduction** (a social choice) interacts with biology to constrain family size in rich nations. Birth rates among women over 40 have risen somewhat in developed countries thanks to IVF and other technologies, but these don’t fully compensate for the fewer childbearing years used.

- **Widespread Contraception and Safe Abortion:** Technological and medical factors allow low fertility by choice. Modern contraceptives (the pill, IUDs, etc.) and access to abortion are not *biological* per se, but they directly control the biological outcome of pregnancy. In wealthy countries, nearly all sexually active people can (and usually do) use some form of birth control to **separate sex from childbearing**. This means that biologically, women in rich societies spend much of their fertile years *not* getting pregnant, whereas in a traditional setting with no contraception, frequent pregnancies would be the norm until biology (breastfeeding or menopause) slows it down. The ability to regulate fertility with scientific precision is a hallmark of developed societies, and it’s a critical factor in maintaining low birthrates. Essentially, **rich countries have the medical means to fulfill the cultural desire for fewer children**.

- **Health and Lifestyle Influences on Fertility:** Paradoxically, some aspects of modern life may **biologically reduce fertility** at the individual level. For example, rising rates of obesity in many wealthy countries can impair fertility in both women and men. Studies also point to environmental factors – **pollutants, endocrine disruptors, and stress** – potentially lowering sperm counts or affecting reproductive health ([Frontiers | What is driving the global decline of human fertility? Need for a multidisciplinary approach to the underlying mechanisms](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/reproductive-health/articles/10.3389/frph.2024.1364352/full#:~:text=underlying%20mechanisms.%20In%20the%20short,uptake%20of%20assisted%20reproductive%20technologies)). While these factors are not the primary drivers of the fertility gap between rich and poor nations, they might contribute subtly. An extreme hypothesis raised by some researchers is that over multiple generations, **natural selection for high fertility might weaken** in low-fertility societies ([Frontiers | What is driving the global decline of human fertility? Need for a multidisciplinary approach to the underlying mechanisms](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/reproductive-health/articles/10.3389/frph.2024.1364352/full#:~:text=nanoplastics%20and%20electromagnetic%20radiation%2C%20are,for%20our%20species%20are%20potentially)). In other words, if for many decades people who have fewer children face no survival disadvantage (and those with fertility problems can still reproduce via IVF), the population’s inherent fertility could biologically decline. This is speculative and long-term, but it highlights that sustained low birthrates could themselves create evolutionary feedback. In the near term, the **rise of assisted reproductive technologies** (common in rich nations) allows individuals with subfertility to have children, potentially keeping genes predisposing lower fertility in the gene pool ([Frontiers | What is driving the global decline of human fertility? Need for a multidisciplinary approach to the underlying mechanisms](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/reproductive-health/articles/10.3389/frph.2024.1364352/full#:~:text=nanoplastics%20and%20electromagnetic%20radiation%2C%20are,for%20our%20species%20are%20potentially)). These biological considerations are complex and still being studied.

- **Mortality-Fertility Link:** One straightforward health link is that in poor countries, **high maternal mortality** and health complications can reduce birthrates (because some women die young or are incapacitated). Wealthy countries have minimal maternal deaths, so nearly every pregnancy is carried to term safely. While this means the *capacity* for having children is high in rich countries, it doesn’t counteract the voluntary low fertility – it just means health is not a limiting factor. If anything, excellent health and nutrition in wealthy nations mean couples *could* biologically have many children if they wanted, but by choice they do not.

In summary, **biology sets the stage but culture directs the play**: humans in rich countries still have the physical capability to reproduce, but due to the factors above, they end up reproducing at a much lower rate. Improved health and survival reduce the need for many births; later fertility and lifestyle factors constrain the number of births; and birth control gives direct command over biology. All these help explain why increased wealth and modern living conditions lead to fewer babies being born.

## Global Patterns and Regional Perspectives  
The trend of lower birthrates with greater wealth is observable across **all regions**, but each region has its own nuances. Here we survey global patterns and highlight any exceptions or unique cases:

- **Europe:** Europe’s developed countries are famous for their **low fertility rates**, often well below replacement. Southern and Eastern Europe have some of the *lowest* birthrates in the world (Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland, etc., with around 1.2–1.5 children per woman). These regions combine high development with cultural factors like strong individualism or economic uncertainties that further depress fertility. Northern and Western Europe (France, UK, Scandinavia) are slightly higher (around 1.6–1.9) but still low. Many European nations experienced fertility decline early (France’s fertility dropped in the 19th century even before it industrialized fully, showing the power of cultural change ([More Money, More Babies: What’s the Relationship Between Income & Fertility? | Institute for Family Studies](https://ifstudies.org/blog/more-money-more-babies-whats-the-relationship-between-income-fertility#:~:text=fertility%20in%20these%20groups%2C%20or%C2%A0culture%3F,is%20nonetheless%20highly%20exposed%20to))). Today, Europe’s wealthy countries have aging populations and slow growth due to decades of low birthrates. Some governments have implemented generous parental leave, childcare, and financial incentives to encourage childbearing (e.g. in France or Sweden), which have had **modest positive effects** – these countries tend to have the “least low” fertility among rich peers, demonstrating that policy can help a bit. However, Europe remains largely a model of how **affluence + modern lifestyles = few children**.

- **North America:** The United States and Canada are wealthy with low fertility, but the US has historically been something of an **outlier** among rich nations. The US total fertility rate (TFR) hovered near replacement (~2.0–2.1) for longer than other advanced countries, only recently (post-2010) dropping to around 1.6–1.7 ([Why Is the U.S. Birth Rate Declining? | PRB](https://www.prb.org/resources/why-is-the-u-s-birth-rate-declining/#:~:text=Between%202007%20and%202020%2C%20the,6)). Possible reasons include a cultural emphasis on family and religion for segments of the population, higher fertility among immigrant communities, and a slightly younger average marriage age than Europe. The U.S. is more socially conservative in some areas, which may encourage having children earlier or in greater number (for example, regions with strong religious communities like Utah or the U.S. South have higher birthrates than more secular regions). However, even the U.S. is now firmly in low-fertility territory, as **education rises and marriage is delayed** nationwide ([Why Is the U.S. Birth Rate Declining? | PRB](https://www.prb.org/resources/why-is-the-u-s-birth-rate-declining/#:~:text=Between%202007%20and%202020%2C%20the,6)). Canada’s fertility is about 1.5, similar to Europe, reflecting very similar urban, educated societal norms. In North America, **immigration has been a factor** that sustained higher birthrates – first-generation immigrants from higher-fertility cultures initially have more children on average, which kept the overall U.S. fertility slightly higher. But studies show by the second generation, immigrant families adopt the low-fertility norms of the broader society ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4255510/#:~:text=The%20fertility%20of%20the%20population,The%20phenomenon%C2%A0carries%20forward)), converging with the typical pattern. So, North America overall fits the wealth-low fertility pattern, with the U.S. being a bit of a **higher-fertility exception among wealthy nations** (though that gap is closing).

- **East Asia:** East Asian economies (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong) are among the richest in the world and now have **extremely low birthrates**. South Korea and Singapore, for instance, have TFRs around *0.8–1.1*, some of the lowest ever recorded. This “ultra-low” fertility is attributed to a combination of high cost of living, intense work culture, late marriage, and in some cases **persistent traditional gender roles** that clash with modern expectations (leading many women to opt out of marriage/motherhood). East Asia demonstrates how the **factors of wealth can sometimes overshoot to produce *very* few births**. The economic pressures (long work hours, expensive education and housing) and social trends (women educated but facing a “second shift” at home) have created a situation where young people are marrying late or not at all, and having very few children. China is a special case: it’s now upper-middle-income and also has a very low birthrate (~1.3). Not only did China experience the usual development-driven decline, but it also had the **One-Child Policy** for decades, strictly limiting births by law. Even though that policy has ended, a culture of small families and the high costs in urban China keep fertility low. Overall, East Asia shows that **high development coupled with modern urban stresses can push birthrates to rock-bottom** levels.

- **Latin America:** Many Latin American countries have undergone a rapid fertility decline in recent decades, even as some are still developing economically. Countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, now middle-income, saw their fertility rates drop from ~6 in the 1960s to near replacement (~2.0) or below today ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8409340/#:~:text=2%20%29,factors%20contributed%20to%20these%20rapid)) ([
            Reduced fertility from better access to contraception may not improve women’s health - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8409340/#:~:text=1970s%2C%20it%20fell%20at%20a,2)). This was achieved through **improvements in education, urbanization, and family planning**. For example, Brazil, despite not being extremely wealthy, now has a TFR around 1.7 – culturally, norms shifted (smaller families became desirable, aided by media like popular soap operas depicting small families) and contraception became widely available. Generally, in Latin America, **urban middle-class lifestyles spread quickly**, and even lower-income people adopted the two-child ideal. Today, most Latin American nations (except a few poorer ones like Guatemala or Bolivia) have fertility at or below 2.5. It’s a case where **cultural modernization and health improvements led fertility decline ahead of tremendous wealth** – a testament to the influence of global norms and local policies. As these countries continue to get richer, they tend to maintain low birthrates similar to other developed regions.

- **Middle East and North Africa:** The Middle East/North Africa region has seen fertility fall as well, but some countries still buck the trend due to cultural factors. Generally, North African nations (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt) have dropped to moderate fertility (~2–3), aligning with their improving development and education levels. The interesting cases are the **oil-rich Gulf states** (like Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait) and others such as Iran. **Iran** underwent one of the fastest fertility transitions in history – from ~6 children per woman in the 1980s to around 2.1 by 2000 – thanks to a massive government family planning program and rising female education. Iran, though only middle-income, now has a birthrate comparable to Europe. In contrast, the **Arab Gulf states**, which are very wealthy, traditionally had high fertility but have significantly declined in recent decades. Saudi Arabia’s TFR has dropped from 6-7 in the 1980s to roughly *2.3–2.4* today ([Saudi Arabia - fertility rate from 2012 to 2022 - Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262472/fertility-rate-in-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=Saudi%20Arabia%20,rate%20during%20the%20observed%20period)). Still, **some of these wealthy Gulf countries remain slightly higher than other rich countries**. For instance, **Qatar’s citizen population** (Qatari nationals) had a fertility rate of about *3.2* as of the mid-2010s ([[PDF] Fertility in Qatar and in Other GCC States](https://gulfmigration.grc.net/media/pubs/rp/NPRP%20Project%20-%20Francoise%20De%20Bel-Air%20-%202019-11-26.pdf#:~:text=,at%20an%20intermediate%20level%2C)), which is high for such a rich country. Culturally, Gulf societies place a strong emphasis on large families and have norms that encourage early marriage and multiple children, especially for citizens. Generous government benefits for each child and reliance on foreign labor for work may also enable higher fertility among nationals. However, the overall national fertility rates of places like the UAE or Qatar are skewed lower when you include the large expatriate workforce (who tend to have fewer or no children while working abroad). **Israel** in the Middle East is another **notable exception**: it is a high-income country *and* the only developed country with a *growing* population from natural increase. Israel’s fertility rate is around *3.0*, extraordinarily high for a wealthy country ([Reflections on Israel’s Exceptional Fertility - Public Discourse](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2024/09/95824/#:~:text=And%20we%20are%20hardly%20alone,become%20%E2%80%9Ca%20teeming%20multitude%20within)). This is largely due to cultural and social factors – a combination of religious traditions (among both Jewish and Arab communities), strong family-oriented values, and government supports. Even secular Israeli Jews have more children on average (~2–3) than people with similar education/income in other countries ([Why are there so many children in Israel? | מרכז טאוב](https://www.taubcenter.org.il/en/research/why-are-there-so-many-children-in-israel/#:~:text=Why%20are%20there%20so%20many,Jewish%20populations%2C%20whose%20combined)). Thus, the Middle East shows both sides: some wealthy places maintaining higher birthrates due to culture (Gulf states, Israel), and others that have transitioned to low fertility (Iran, Turkey, etc.). 

- **South Asia:** South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc.) has a mix of fertility stages. **Bangladesh** and **India** have made great strides – Bangladesh, as mentioned, fell to about 2.0; India is around 2.0 as well in many states (though still higher in some northern states). These declines happened at relatively modest income levels, through education and family planning outreach. **Pakistan** and **Afghanistan** remain higher (3-4+ range) due to slower social change and less female education in some areas. Generally, as parts of South Asia become more affluent and urban (e.g., Indian cities, Sri Lanka, etc.), they show the same low birthrate patterns of other regions. Cultural diversity is huge, but even historically high-fertility cultures (for example, in India) are moving toward small families with development.

- **Sub-Saharan Africa:** Africa is the region with the **highest birthrates today**, and many countries are still in earlier stages of the demographic transition. Most of Sub-Saharan Africa remains low-income, and fertility rates above 4 or 5 are common (Niger, for instance, still around 6.8 – one of the highest in the world). However, even in Africa, there are variations. Some countries with relative stability and education improvements (like Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana) have seen fertility drops into the 3–4 range. The **wealthier or more developed parts of Africa** – such as **South Africa** or the small island nations like Mauritius and the Seychelles – have much lower fertility (around 2.1–2.5 or less). South Africa, for example, is upper-middle-income and has a TFR near 2.3, reflecting good access to contraception and urban lifestyles. Still, overall Africa lags in the fertility decline mainly because many countries have not yet achieved the economic and social changes needed. As Africa develops in the future, one expects its birthrates to fall considerably (the UN projections assume this). It’s worth noting Africa has some **cultural factors** (like preference for large families, and in some places lower contraceptive use) that keep fertility high, but those too are changing with education and urban living. In summary, Africa today illustrates the **before state** – low wealth, high fertility – which is exactly the scenario that flips as countries get richer.

In all these regional perspectives, the overarching pattern holds: **higher development tends to coincide with lower birthrates**. But the timelines differ, and cultural/policy contexts can create **exceptions** where the pattern isn’t as straightforward.

## Notable Exceptions and Outliers  
While the inverse correlation between wealth and birthrates is strong, it is not absolute. There are some important exceptions and outliers that highlight how **culture and policy can modulate the typical pattern**:

- **Israel – High Fertility in a Wealthy Country:** As mentioned, Israel stands out as a prosperous nation (OECD member) with a fertility rate around 3, roughly double the average of other rich countries ([Reflections on Israel’s Exceptional Fertility - Public Discourse](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2024/09/95824/#:~:text=recent%20decades%2C%20Israel%E2%80%99s%20population%20growth,%E2%80%9D)) ([Reflections on Israel’s Exceptional Fertility - Public Discourse](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2024/09/95824/#:~:text=And%20we%20are%20hardly%20alone,become%20%E2%80%9Ca%20teeming%20multitude%20within)). This exception is often attributed to unique cultural and social factors. Israeli society (across Jewish and Arab populations) places a high value on family and children. Among Jewish Israelis, there is a mix of secular and religious communities, but even secular birthrates (around 2) are higher than in Europe, and the more religious groups (Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox Jews) have very large families, which raises the national average. There is also a pronatalist sentiment tied to historical and security considerations (ensuring a thriving population has been seen as important since the nation’s founding). Additionally, Israel provides substantial support for families: affordable childcare, child allowances, and accessible fertility treatments (Israel has one of the highest per-capita rates of IVF use, even for women who already have children, reflecting a societal support for childbearing). All these factors combine to make Israel **“unusually fecund”** for its income level ([Reflections on Israel’s Exceptional Fertility - Public Discourse](https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2024/09/95824/#:~:text=And%20we%20are%20hardly%20alone,become%20%E2%80%9Ca%20teeming%20multitude%20within)). It demonstrates that **strong cultural/religious motivation can sustain higher birthrates** even in a modern economy.

- **Oil-Rich Gulf States:** The Gulf monarchies (Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia) have very high per capita incomes, yet their fertility rates have only recently come down toward replacement and in some cases remain slightly above what one might expect for their wealth. For example, **Qatar and Kuwait have had total fertility around 3 for their citizens in recent years** ([[PDF] Fertility in Qatar and in Other GCC States](https://gulfmigration.grc.net/media/pubs/rp/NPRP%20Project%20-%20Francoise%20De%20Bel-Air%20-%202019-11-26.pdf#:~:text=,at%20an%20intermediate%20level%2C)). **Saudi Arabia’s** fertility was about 2.4 in 2022 (and closer to 2.7 for Saudi nationals specifically) – still higher than most rich countries, though on a declining trend ([Saudi Arabia - fertility rate from 2012 to 2022 - Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262472/fertility-rate-in-saudi-arabia/#:~:text=Saudi%20Arabia%20,rate%20during%20the%20observed%20period)) ([Grim warning: Writer warns of declining population in Saudi Arabia](https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/grim-warning-writer-predicts-saudi-arabias-extinction-1.500031508#:~:text=Grim%20warning%3A%20Writer%20warns%20of,the%20fertility%20rate%20for)). These exceptions exist because **cultural and government contexts differ**: in many of these countries, traditional norms of early marriage and large families persisted longer, women’s workforce participation remained relatively lower (though it’s changing now), and governments often encouraged population growth among citizens. Also, because a large share of the population are expatriates (who generally have fewer children while working abroad and are often excluded from citizenship), the *nationals* may consciously maintain higher fertility to ensure their community grows. However, even these countries are trending downward as they urbanize and educate their populations – for instance, the UAE and Bahrain now have very low fertility (around 1.4–1.7), more in line with other developed nations ([Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN#:~:text=Fertility%20rate%2C%20total%20,Singapore)) ([Fertility rates across Middle East and Asia. Any surprises for you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1fxwtom/fertility_rates_across_middle_east_and_asia_any/#:~:text=you%3F%20www,on%20par%20with%20Pakistan%2C)). The Gulf states illustrate a **lag in the typical pattern** due to culture and policy, but not a complete defiance of it.

- **High-Fertility Poor Countries:** On the flip side, some countries manage to have **lower fertility despite low income** – usually through active policy interventions or particular social dynamics. We discussed **Bangladesh**, which achieved near-replacement fertility while still being relatively poor, thanks to one of the world’s most effective family planning campaigns and community health programs ([
            Reduced fertility from better access to contraception may not improve women’s health - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8409340/#:~:text=Asian%20and%20Latin%20American%20countries,women%E2%80%99s%20education%2C%20motivated%20parents%20to)) ([
            Reduced fertility from better access to contraception may not improve women’s health - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8409340/#:~:text=1970s%2C%20it%20fell%20at%20a,2)). **Rwanda** is another example: after the turmoil of the 1990s, Rwanda’s government promoted family planning, and fertility fell from ~6 to ~4 in a short span, even as the economy is still developing. **Cuba** is a notable case as well – not a wealthy country, but its fertility dropped below replacement decades ago, likely due to high education and access to healthcare/contraception (Cuba’s social indicators are similar to a developed country’s in many ways, despite limited income). These cases show that **it’s not solely wealth that lowers birthrates**; targeted efforts in health and education can preemptively reduce fertility. They serve as **exceptions that prove the rule** – because once those societies improved education, health, and women’s status (even without high GDP), fertility fell. In other words, it’s the facets of development (education, empowerment, mortality decline) more than just money that matter.

- **Within-Country Exceptions (Subcultures):** Even inside wealthy countries, certain subgroups may have higher fertility due to cultural values. For instance, the **Amish in the United States** or **Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jews in Israel** have very high birthrates, sustaining traditional norms in the midst of a modern economy. Similarly, in Europe, immigrant communities from higher-fertility regions initially have more children on average, though this usually adjusts over time. These subculture exceptions highlight how **culture can override economic influences** to an extent – if a community highly values children or has religious injunctions to have large families, they may do so even if the broader society’s trend is opposite. However, these are relatively small pockets in the context of entire nations.

- **Fertility J-Curve at Very High Development:** An interesting emerging observation is that in the **most highly developed countries**, the decline in fertility may bottom out and even uptick slightly at the extreme high end of the Human Development Index (HDI). Researchers Myrskylä, Kohler, and Billari (2009) noted that countries with *very* high development (HDI above a certain threshold) sometimes see a minor reversal in fertility decline ([Demographic transition: Why is rapid population growth a temporary phenomenon? - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition#:~:text=,see%20a%20decline%20in%20the)). For example, countries like **Sweden, France, or Denmark** – all wealthy – have seen their fertility inch back up from lows of ~1.5 to around ~1.8 after adopting more family-friendly policies and as gender norms slowly adjust. The idea is that once a society achieves a certain level of wealth, education, gender equality, and work-life balance policies, it can alleviate some obstacles to childbearing, allowing fertility to recover marginally. This is not a return to high fertility by any means, but it suggests that **the relationship between development and fertility isn’t a straight line downward forever**. Instead, it might be an *L-shape or J-shape*, where fertility falls with development and then stabilizes or rises a bit at the highest development levels (though still below replacement) ([Demographic transition: Why is rapid population growth a temporary phenomenon? - Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/demographic-transition#:~:text=,see%20a%20decline%20in%20the)). This is why some demographers speak of a possible **“Stage 5”** of the demographic transition, where very advanced societies find a new equilibrium of slightly higher fertility than the nadir. Still, this “bounce back” is relatively small and not guaranteed – some of the richest places (like Singapore or Hong Kong) have *not* seen a rebound so far.

In conclusion, exceptions often occur when **cultural imperatives or deliberate policies counteract the usual economic and social pressures** that come with wealth. Israel and the Gulf states maintain higher birthrates because their cultures (and sometimes government incentives) strongly encourage it. Some poor countries manage lower birthrates by proactively providing education and contraception. And at the micro level, groups with particular values can sustain high fertility within low-fertility nations. These exceptions are important to understand, but they do not overturn the general global pattern.

## Conclusion  
Wealthier countries tend to have lower birthrates due to a complex interplay of long-term historical processes and contemporary factors. Over generations, societies that improved survival and became more prosperous went from a regime of **“many births, many deaths” to “few births, few deaths.”** Economic development brings about conditions – higher cost of living, greater female education and workforce participation, urban lifestyles, and reliable birth control – that make small families the norm. Sociologically, people in rich nations marry later and have different life priorities than in agrarian times, which naturally limits childbearing. Culturally, values shift toward personal fulfillment and away from seeing large families as essential. Biologically, the combination of low mortality and later childbearing reinforces the trend.

Every global region has followed this trajectory to some extent, from Europe’s 19th-20th century decline to Asia and Latin America’s late-20th century decline, and now gradually in Africa. The **drivers** – education, urbanization, female empowerment, reduced need for child labor, and access to contraception – are evident in each case. Empirical data strongly support these factors: for example, increasing female schooling is one of the most powerful predictors of falling fertility ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=India%2C%20illustrated%20this%20trend%20by,7)), and worldwide the inverse correlation between GDP per capita and fertility is clear ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=Income%20and%20fertility%20%20is,who)).

That said, fertility is not determined by wealth alone. We have seen how **culture can moderate** the effect (with some wealthy societies choosing higher fertility, and some poorer ones managing to lower fertility). Policies and social norms make a difference: pronatalist policies can nudge fertility up a bit in rich countries, and aggressive family planning can pull it down in poorer ones. But fundamentally, once the **“development threshold”** is crossed – where children reliably survive, women are educated, and living standards rise – fertility nearly always declines. This seems to be a near-universal human response; as one demographer quipped, people don’t *want* ten kids when five of them will survive – they’d rather have two or three that survive, and once even two are guaranteed to survive, they might choose to have only one.

In summary, **economic prosperity and modernization set in motion powerful forces that lead to lower birthrates**. These include the **economic logic** of investing more in fewer children ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=childbirth%20and%20parenting%20rather%20than,12)), the **opportunity costs** of parenting in a high-income career-oriented environment ([Income and fertility - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#:~:text=,12)), the expanded **role of women** beyond motherhood ([
            Declining birth rate in Developed Countries: A radical policy re-think is required - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4255510/#:~:text=is%20easily%20accessible%20and%20children,in%20a%20demographic%20economic%20paradox)), and the transformation of **cultural norms** about family size. Long-term data and recent patterns alike confirm this: as countries climb the development ladder, their fertility tends to drop. The notable exceptions – whether an outlier country or a subculture – usually highlight the importance of cultural or policy factors that go against the grain. Understanding all these factors is crucial for policymakers grappling with aging populations in rich countries or with rapid population growth in poorer ones. 

Ultimately, the case of wealth and birthrates is a story of how **human societies change with progress**: the shift from valuing quantity of children toward valuing the quality of upbringing, and from uncontrolled reproduction toward conscious family planning. It is one of the most significant social transformations of the past two centuries, touching every region and illustrating how deeply economics, sociology, culture, and biology interconnect in shaping demographic outcomes.
