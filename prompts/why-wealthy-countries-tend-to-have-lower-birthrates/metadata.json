  "sceneDescription": "A weary stork stands outside a sleek corporate tower, holding a single baby snug in a lavish stroller. Passersby in elegant suits walk calmly by, apparently child-free and absorbed in their routines. Far in the distance, a simpler rural horizon shows many storks flapping about with larger bundles. The sparse scene underscores the paradox of wealth and shrinking families.",
  "illustrationExplanation": "2. This illustration effectively captures the contrast between the low birthrates in wealthier countries and the busy corporate environment. The stork with a single baby in a lavish stroller stands out amidst the elegant, child-free commuters, highlighting the theme of prosperity and declining family sizes. The distant storks with larger bundles further emphasize the paradox. The composition and humor are subtle, fitting well with The New Yorker style."
