  "sceneDescription": "In a small lecture hall, a thoughtful philosopher stands in a draped tunic while wearing modern sneakers. A large chalkboard behind him is covered in looping arrows that converge, diverge, then intertwine again in a continuous tangle. A handful of onlookers sit on simple chairs, each with quietly puzzled expressions. The philosopher gazes calmly at the apparent contradictions on the board, suggesting that deeper truths may reside in the very tension between opposing ideas.",
